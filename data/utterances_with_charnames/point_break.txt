right wall. => ACCELERATING INTO REAL TIME -- as he stares into the pit, digs in, drops into the sweet spot on the wave, hunkers down. His moves becoming aggressive, frenzied--
--BAAAAAAMMM! => Glass doors explode OPEN and Pig Nose #1 SPINS inside.  He fires a burst into the ceiling.  BRRAAMM!!
PEOPLE drop. => VERY FAST HERE-- Two bandits handle BANK EMPLOYEES and customers-- Another PIG NOSE watches the door-- Pig Nose #1 moves behind counter, Uzi and canvas sack in hand.
BINOCULARS => Bingo.  We're on.  Let's go. Where's the big college quarterback?!  Are you with us, Utah?
BINOCULARS => Utah, where the hell are ya!?
slick pavement. => The sedan launches down the alley.
LADY PIGNOSE => Son of a bitch!
UTAH => Halt.  FBI!
BINOCULARS => This far, Utah!  You're this far from being the most overqualified guy Burger King ever had.  Get me?!
UTAH => Yes sir.  Sir?
BINOCULARS => What?
UTAH => I did stop the perpetrators.
seat. => The driver turns to us.
DRIVER => Anywhere?  You don't care?
UTAH => Anywhere.  I've just never seen the ocean before.
VOICE => Day One in LA, special agent Utah. You may have been top two percent of your class at Quantico but you have exactly zero hours in the field here.  You know nothing...
HARP => You know less than nothing.  If you even knew that you knew nothing, at least that would be something, but you don't.
UTAH => Yes, sir.
HARP => Eating solid breakfasts, Utah?
UTAH => Sir?
HARP => All the food groups?  Avoiding sugar?  Caffeine?  I see to it that my people maintain cardiovascular fitness.  We stay off hard liquor, cigarettes...
UTAH =>  I take the skin off chicken.
HARP => This is us.  Bank Robbery.  And you're in the bank-robbery capital of the world--
UTAH => 1322 last year in LA county.  Up 26 percent from the year before.
HARP => That's right.  And we nailed over a thousand of them.  We did it by crunching data.  Good crime-scene work, good lab work, good data-base analysis.  Nobody had to tackle a car once.  You getting the signal, special agent?
UTAH => Zero distortion, sir.
UTAH => I love these things.
HARP => You're a real blue-flame special, aren't you, Utah?  I don't know why they sent you to LA.  Must be an asshole shortage.
UTAH => Not so far.
PAPPAS => The dolls love this baby.  It brings them luck when they rub it -- right between their buttons.
COREY => Angelo, we need a bigger tape.
PAPPAS => Just read the goddamn number.
COREY => Still a 46.  Maybe we can cinch it down, wear a girdle--
PAPPAS => Screw you and this holistic fitness crap!  At least my arms don't flap in the wind.
BIG SHOULDERS => Okay, Pappas, let's put on the blindfold.  Wanna see you retrieve at least two bricks from the bottom.
PAPPAS => I've been in the field 33 years, fired my piece 23 times in the line of duty, and I got no idea what a blind man fetching bricks has gotta do with being a Special Agent!
PAPPAS => Added to which indignity, I got three months left to retirement and they saddle me with some blue-flamer fresh out of Quantico for a partner. Some quarterback punk, Johnny Unitas or something.
UTAH => The shit they pull, huh?
holler. => Corey swears and wipes off his clipboard. Johnny steps to the edge, looks down. We see the blindfolded Pappas groveling along the bottom. The other agents cheer as Pappas heads for the surface.
COREY => Here he comes.  Hold up a fish, he'll take it right outta your hand.
COREY => Hey Shamu, this is your guy.
PAPPAS => Pappas.  Angelo Pappas.
UTAH => Punk.  Quarterback Punk.
PAPPAS =>  Welcome to Sea World, kid.
seconds. => Magnum shells are fed into a pump shotgun. Velcro straps of Second Chance body armor are fastened. White gloves are pulled snug over strong hands. A silk tie is straightened.  A shotgun slide is cocked. The sweep hand approaches the twelve. A LATEX MASK is pulled over the back of a man's head.
VOICE => The little hand says...
REAGAN => ... let's rock and roll.
gauge. => The other guard goes for his holster -- finds himself facing three shotguns and one very large handgun. Reagan sights down the pistol.
REAGAN => Use a gun, go to heaven.
REAGAN => EVERYBODY FREEZE!!  That's right. ALL TELLERS step back from the counter!  Hands on heads!  MOVE!!
REAGAN => Everybody else on the floor!  Do it! On the floor, let's go.
NIXON => SUCK LINOLEUM, BITCH!!  You got earwax?!
the floor. => She lands hard.  Everyone is on the deck by now. The Presidents move fast. Reagan leaps onto the counter.  Stands up where he can see all. Nixon hurdles to tellers' side and they start moving down the line together.  Reagan controlling the room as Nixon quickly empties the tellers' cash drawers into the sack. His hands move like lightning.
REAGAN => Just stay cool.  Everybody stay cool.  Heads down.  Eyes down.  The money's insured--
REAGAN => -- it's not worth dying for. Another 45 seconds of your time. That's all.  Then -- Whoa, Tricky Dick!
it. => Then drops it like a hot-potato just before-- It EXPLODES into a cloud of blue ink.  The manager is dyed blue. Burnt money showers on the terrified customers.
PAPPAS => Twenty-seven banks in three years. In and out in 90 seconds.  Nobody ever gets shot.  We're talking solid professionals.
videotape. => The bandits barge in, raise shotguns and order everybody to the floor.
UTAH => Good move.
PAPPAS => Yeah, they control the room well. Stick strictly to the cash drawers.
UTAH => They don't go for the vault?
PAPPAS => Never go for the vault.  They never get greedy.
UTAH => Smart.  You burn time in the vault.
PAPPAS => Reagan usually drives.  Stolen switch car, they leave it running at the curb, looks parked from a distance.  When they run, they dump the vehicle and vanish.  And I mean vanish.
UTAH => Surgical.  Look at them separate the dye packs.  Dick and Ronny know their jobs.
PAPPAS => The Ex-Presidents are the best I've seen, kid.
frightened customers. => Hotshot agents MUNOZ and COLE enter from the main floor of the bank.  Think they're very slick.
MUNOZ => Anytime you two are finished jerking off watching MTV I need to get a look at that tape.
COLE =>  Hey, Pappas, you tell the kid your theory on the Presidents?
PAPPAS => Just take the tape, Cole.
MUNOZ => Hang ten, Pappas, like totally rad...  I gotta tell ya, the department loves it.
UTAH => What's he talking about, Angelo?
HARP => They found the drop car up on Mulholland.  I want you two to go work it.
PAPPAS => What?  Now I'm working the drop car? Who's handling the scene here?
HARP => Cole and Munoz.  I'm uh... letting them run with the ball for a while.
PAPPAS => Cole and Munoz?  I been on this case for two years.
HARP =>  That's the point, isn't it?
PAPPAS => Yeah, I get it.  Time to play let's dick the old guys, huh, Harp?
HARP => Supervising Special Agent, Harp. Now I want you to go work the drop car, okay, Angelo?  Okay?
PAPPAS => Sure.  No problem.  How about your office?  Your office need vacuuming? We could do that too.
PAPPAS => Excuse me.
blue disco. => A flock of UNIFORMS milling about a non-descript CHEVY.
PAPPAS => Cute huh?  They love to fuck with us.
PAPPAS => Don't tell me, let me guess.  The switch-car was stolen this morning... (Halsey is nodding his head) They vacuumed and 409'd the interior, did the windows, emptied the ashtrays...
HALSEY => Yeah, the usual drill.
UTAH => Could've taken their gloves off before setting that card.  Laser it for prints.  Maybe held it to his teeth -- check the edges for saliva.  Today was a scorcher.  This Chevy doesn't have air conditioning...
HALSEY => Sweat secretions in the seatbacks?
PAPPAS => You through, Mr. Wizard?  Let me know if you find Jimmy Hoffa under the seat while you're at it.  Hell, it's only 7:30.  The night's still young... you can solve this case and start on another one.
UTAH => Well, what're your ideas on these guys?
PAPPAS => Forget about it, kid.  They're ghosts.  Let the goddamn yuppie Mormon affirmative action assholes handle it.  See I'm almost 55... so I must be senile, right?  They better get me out before I start pissing myself in public.  Drooling. It would look bad for the Bureau, right?
UTAH => So you're gonna coast to retirement, when you could nail these guys and go out with come dignity.
PAPPAS => You watch your fucking mouth!  Mr. Hoover himself pinned the Seal of Honor right here!
UTAH => Sorry.
PAPPAS => Yeah.  That was thirty years ago anyway. (stares out at the bright horizon) L.A.'s changed a lot since then. The air got dirty and the sex got clean.  So you want to nail the Ex- Presidents?  Be a big hero?
UTAH => Yeah.  What's your theory?
PAPPAS => The fucking punks are surfers.
PAPPAS => I'm tellin' ya, kid, it's in our face.  Lookit the tan on this guy.
UTAH => Oh well he must be a surfer.
PAPPAS => Shutup, you might learn somethin' you're not careful... So last year Nixon scuffs a counter going over. There was a soil sample.  Non- specific mud traces of asphalt, oils, blah, blah... sand and... carnuba wax.  So I became a wax expert.  There's 80 some uses for this stuff, something like five hundred products.
UTAH => Candle wax.  Car wax.  Mustache wax? Could be anything.  Guy's waxing his mustache at the beach.  Gets sand in it.  Wipes it off with a shoe.  Shoe scuffs the counter.
PAPPAS => The lab made three possible matches, this was one of 'em.
cellophane. => A block of "Mr. Zog's Sex Wax".
UTAH =>  Sex wax?  You're not into kinky shit, are you Angelo?
PAPPAS => Surfers use it on their boards. They rub sand into it for traction.
UTAH => Thanks for the tip.  I needed this knowledge.
PAPPAS => Now lookit the dates on the robberies.  This is strictly a summer job for these guys.
UTAH => ... Four months.  June to October. Mmmm...same the year before.
PAPPAS => Another month and we don't see 'em again 'til next summer.
UTAH => They're traveling the rest of the year on the money, going where the waves are...
PAPPAS =>  The Ex-Presidents rip off banks to finance their endless summer!
UTAH => I think he needs a vacation.
UTAH => I don't.
PAPPAS =>  "Best for your stick", huh?  This might not be enough.  I better get two.
UTAH => I'm twenty-five.
PAPPAS => Johnny, it's the only way.
UTAH => Why can't I just walk around with this thing under my arm and act stoned?  Ask a few questions.
PAPPAS => Look.  Look at them out there.
PAPPAS => They're like some kind of tribe. Got their own language.  You can't just walk up to these guys.  You've got to get out there.  Learn some moves.  Get into their head.  Pick up the speech.
UTAH => Angelo, this stuff is for little rubber people who don't shave yet.
PAPPAS => It's all balance, right?  And coordination.  How hard can it be?
PAPPAS => I think you gotta hit them straight on!
UTAH =>  Got it...
LOCAL => Outta the way, you dick!
LOCAL 2 => Move it, kook!
paddling hard. => He somehow gets the soles of his feet in contact with the top of the board, then struggles up.  He's standing -- sort of. Arms pinwheeling, he topples in a nasty crash... Right in front of a SHAVED-HEAD SURFER on full afterburner.
SHOOTS OUT. => It SMASHES SIDEWAYS INTO RAZORHEAD. The guy does an ugly endo. Utah comes up GASPING for air, arms flailing. His board, floating a few feet away, tugging at his ankle. He drapes his torso across the board and pants for breath. Razorhead, already back on his board, paddles over. Points to a small dent in the fiberglass.
RAZORHEAD => You dinged my board, kook!!
RAZORHEAD => Politeness counts, ASSHOLE!
UTAH => Goddamn son-of-a--
PAPPAS => Kid, maybe this ain't your sport.
a dancer. => Dipping, carving, slicing, making it look sooooo easy. Johnny shakes his head.  Oh man, if she can do it...
UTAH => Fuck it.
OCEAN BREAK => A horizon of whitecaps churn behind him. He lies on his board, rising and dropping with the swell. So far so good.  He spots a wave.  A fluid gray-green house rising, forever rising.  Utah turns.  Paddles.  The house catching him, lifting him high upon its roof.
WOMAN SURFER =>  Swim, goddammit!  Come on!  Move it!
painful grip. => With powerful strokes, she helps Utah make it to calmer water outside the break.  The big waves, just forming up, lift them and drop them as they pass.  Muted thunder when the waves hit the beach.  She drags him half onto her surfboard. Practically slamming his face into the board. He's coughing out saltwater.
burn bright. => Especially when she's pissed.
WOMAN => Look crazy son of a bitch!  You wanna commit suicide, you do it someplace else!
WOMAN => Look at this pig-board piece-a-shit. It's still got the price tag on it, for Chrissakes.  What'd you do, buy it yesterday?  You've got no business out here whatsoever.
UTAH => Well, I saw you and--
WOMAN => Yeah, you saw me and you figured that if a mere girl can do it, a big strong stud like you shouldn't have any problem.  Right?!  Well you figured wrong, dork!
UTAH => Hey!  Uh, how do I get back in?
WOMAN =>  Carefully, tough guy.  Very carefully.
UTAH =>  My name's Johnny Utah!
WOMAN => Who cares!
UTAH => I'm telling you so when you look back on this moment, you can think... there was this guy named Utah and he was pretty much a dork but maybe not such a bad person and I let him drown in conditions he had no business being in whatsoever... when I could have easily helped him.
UTAH =>  Bye.
WOMAN => Wait!  Jesus Christ! (swimming back to him) You're fucking crazy, you know that? You go in there you're gonna eat it on the rocks.  Here, follow me.
WOMAN => Go when I say.  But stay down.  Just lie on the board.  Alright, let's go!
does. => He is borne up by a low glassy wall. He bellyboards all the way into the mushy shorebreak. Tumbles.  Stands unsteadily, grabbing his board.  Runs clumsily out of the retreating foam as another wave comes, sucking water out. On terra firma he looks back to see the woman kick-out gracefully and disappear beyond the wave.
computer. => She is purebred American Indian, strong featured and beautiful. The screen freezes and the hard disk churns. The DMV rap sheet scrolls down the screen.
PAPPAS => This is your surfer contact? Female.  Blond hair.  Green eyes. 5'6".  119 lbs?
MISS DEER => Hmm, not bad, Utah.
UTAH => Tyler Ann Endicott.  Born 11-27-64.
UTAH =>  ... Exhibition of speed.  Indecent exposure inside moving vehicle...
MISS DEER => Hot, very hot.
UTAH => Felony arrest!  "See adjoining file"...  Kidnapping?!
PAPPAS => This is great.  She ties some guy up.  Nude.  Leaves the scene and fails to return for 24 hours.  No convection.
MISS DEER => Gotta avoid the rope tricks, Johnny.
UTAH => What else they got on her?  I still haven't found anything I can really use.  I gotta find an approach, a way in -- here we go...  Both parents deceased.  Plane crash. San Diego, '84.  Mmmm.  Yeah, definitely.
TYLER => Next!  Oh, no.
TYLER => What do you want?
UTAH => Shrimp and fries.
TYLER => I mean, what do you want?  What are you doing hanging around here.
UTAH =>  I need you to teach me.
TYLER => Gimme a break.  One shrimp and fries to go!  Anything to drink?
UTAH => I'm serious.
TYLER => I can see that.  But forget it. Stick to tennis, or whatever you're good at.  Miniature golf.  Here, your number's 37.
UTAH => Well, I'm just gonna go back out there till I catch on to it or break my neck.
TYLER => What is it?  You all of a sudden got this bug you had to go surfing? This is a line, right?
UTAH => No, no.  See, all my life I've done things for other people.  In high school I played football because my old man expected me to.  Then my parents always figured I'd go to law school, so I did.  Football scholarship.  Graduated Phi Beta Kappa--
TYLER => This gonna take long?
UTAH => Wait, so I'm a big hero to my folks, right? (he leans forward, a little awkward) But two years ago they got killed in a car wreck and I just suddenly realized all my goals had been their goals.  And I hadn't been living my own life.  So I wanted something for myself.  Something that maybe didn't make any sense.  You know what I mean?
UTAH => I came out here from Ohio a month ago.  Never saw the ocean before.  I didn't think it would effect me so much.  Like I'm drawn to it, or something.  I want to do what you do.  It's the truth.
TYLER => Tomorrow, 6 AM.  Here.  If you're a minute late I'm gone.  And Stud... I didn't take you to raise.  I can show you a few things but after that you're on your own. That'll be four fifty.
UTAH => Keep the change, Teach.
TYLER => Stop here.  Do you agree to do exactly what I say when I say it?
UTAH => Sure.
stance. => Suddenly, he drops OUT OF FRAME.
TYLER => Do it again.
surfing. => For about three seconds.  He flies off the deck, ass over teakettle. On the SPLASH we start--
TYLER =>  I'm not with him.
TYLER => It's closing out completely.  Let's call it.
UTAH => Who's that?
him. => SILHOUETTED against a crimson sky and backlit spray the figure pumps among the pier pilings in a frenzy of motion that is somehow balletic. Laying out bottom turns, torquing his body and blasting the lip a few times, moving so fast his long dark hair stands straight back as if he were leaning out a car window on the freeway.
TYLER => That's Bodhi.  They call his the Bodhisattva.
air. => Gawkers HOWL and shout praise at the manic surfer.
TYLER => The modern savage.  Guy's even crazier than you, Johnny Utah. C'mon.
ROACH => Brah!
head. => He watches as-- The Bodhisattva, board under arm, walking out of the whitewater, makes a one-handed chest catch.
BODHI => Hey Tyler!
Sacking him. => They lie together in a heap, laughing.
ROACH => The fuck you doin' man?!  You fuckin' crazy?
BODHI => Chill, brah.  You know who this is? Johnny Utah.  Ohio State, all- conference.  Rose Bowl three years ago.  Right?
ROACH => Johnny fuckin' Utah!  Fuckin'-A! Yeah, I remember that game, man. You were on-fire.  They could not stop your ass.
GROMMET => Radical!  Head-butt, dude!!
GROMMET => Head-butt!!!
BODHI => Something happened.  You got nuked in the last quarter.
UTAH => Yeah, my knee got folded about 90 degrees the wrong way.
BODHI => And that's why you never went pro?
UTAH => Two years of surgery.  I missed my window.  Limped through law school instead.
BODHI => Mmm.  A lawyer, huh?  Too bad.  But at least you're surfing now.  So your life's not over yet, right?
UTAH => Not yet.
COLE => Like totally rad stick, dude.
SEVERAL AGENTS => Gnarly, man... hang ten... cowabunga... surf patrol... rip it up!
HARP => How was the beach?
UTAH => Fine.
HARP => Surf conditions okay?
UTAH => A little mushy.
HARP => A little mushy!  You think the taxpayers would like it, Utah, if they knew they were paying a federal agent to surf and pick up girls?
UTAH => Babes.
HARP => What?
UTAH => The correct term is babes, sir.  Uh, this type of undercover operation is entirely dependent on picking up the idiom of the speech.  Otherwise penetration is not possible, sir. Of the social infrastructure, I mean.
HARP => Where is Pappas?
HARP => Special Agent Utah, this is not some job flippin' burgers at the drive-in. Yes, the surfboard bothers me.  Yes, your approach to this case bothers me.  And yes, you bother me.  You two have produced squat in the last two weeks, during which time the Ex- Presidents have robbed two more banks!!  Do you have anything even remotely interesting to tell me?
UTAH => Caught my first tube this morning.
PAPPAS => What, you couldn't have just left the thing in your car?
UTAH => It sticks out, so I can't lock it. Look, Angelo, you think I joined the FBI to learn to surf?  This was your lame-o idea in the first place.  You gotta back me up on this.
PAPPAS => Johnny, all I can say is we better come up with something real soon.
MISS DEER => Encino Savings & Loan guard grabbed LBJ's ponytail.  We recovered one hair.
PAPPAS => Yeah, yeah, I remember, last year. Guy got his jaw broken for it.
MISS DEER => One four centimeter strand.  Color brown.  Oily.  Slight wave.
PAPPAS => Hell, what're we waiting for, let's go pick the guy up.
UTAH => Angelo, pay attention.  There's gonna be a test afterward.  Lab is showing traces of toxins.  PCBs. Heavy elements... selenium, titanium and arsenic.
PAPPAS => Guy's the Toxic Avenger.
UTAH => The beaches are always being closed because of waste spills, right?  And surfers are territorial.  They stick mostly to certain breaks.  If we can get some hair samples, and get a match to a certain beach, we'd know which break the Ex-Presidents surf. You buyin' this?
PAPPAS => No.  But let's do it, anyway.  It's gonna bug the shit out of Harp.
billowing smoke. => The two wear T-shirts which read "Passion for Slashin" and "Psycho Stick". PAPPAS smiles, standing there in his beach wear, trying to blend in.  He doesn't.
PAPPAS => When you two are done makin' out, I need to talk to you.
"PSYCHO-STICK" T-SHIRT => Hey, I ain't no butt-bouncer, dude. We're from the valley.  Mall babes 'n shit.
PAPPAS => I just want to know if you surf here a lot.
scissors. => Brandishes them like some over-the-hill "Jason".
PAPPAS => Not exactly, dudes.
hoods. => Utah moves along the cars, looking surfed-out. He's tanned, relaxed.  Hair starting to bleach out.  One of the tribe.
UTAH => Whoa, brah, easy now... Don't move! (Utah bends close, reaching for Surf- Rat's ear) Got some huge sucker crawling into your-- (he plucks at a tuft of hair) Got it!  Uuuughhh.
SURF-RAT => Leave some fuckin' hair, man!
SURF-RAT => What was it?
UTAH => Saved your butt, bro.  Close one.
HALSEY => Naw, this isn't it.
sticking out. => PAPPAS shrugs.
PAPPAS => He moved.
HALSEY => PCBs, selenium, titanium, arsenic. The percentages look right.  Here's a match.
UTAH => Latigo Beach.
PAPPAS => Surf's up, ace.
with boards. => Talking, sitting with pubescent girls. The image settles on Johnny, astride his board, bobbing beyond the break.
ride. => The modest wave carries him toward the beach as he balances, tense and style-less.
guy. => But Razorhead definitely sees him.
UTAH => Big zippo so far.  How about you?
PAPPAS => Patience hotshot.  Patience.  It'll be subtle, if it's here at all.
chains. => TONE, ARCHBOLD and WARCHILD.  The one who socked Utah before is BUNKER.  They spread out flanking him.
WARCHILD => This the guy?
BUNKER => Yeah.
UTAH =>  Okay, so this is where you tell me all about how locals rule and yuppie insects like me shouldn't be surfing your break and all that, right?
BUNKER => No.
TONE => Waste of time.
WARCHILD => We're just going to fuck you up.
UTAH => Oh.
the offensive. => Bunker takes him to his knees with a vicious karate-style side-kick.
PAPPAS => Johnny?  You there?
ARCHBOLD => The dude can fight!
face. => Utah breaks free, staggering back on the sand.  The fight is still there in his eyes.
BODHI => Back off!  Now!!  Just let it go!
BUNKER => Stay outta this, Bodhi!
BODHI => He's with me.  Now back off. Seriously.Just do it!  You alright Warchild?
WARCHILD =>  Fuck you.
UTAH => What's your name?
BUNKER => Bunker.
UTAH => Well, listen, Bunker... I'm actually kinda glad you found me.
BUNKER => Yeah?  Why?
BODHI => Whoa!  Whoa!  Hold it, ladies.  Give it a rest.  Let's go.
BODHI =>  Do me a favor, Johnny, just keep walking.
PAPPAS =>  Uh, you guys seen a kid, maybe 10, 12, running with a car stereo? Stole the fucking CD too, you believe it?
UTAH => No, but there are four guys back there you might check out.
PAPPAS => Thanks, buddy.
UTAH => Friends of yours, huh?
BODHI => The one you decked is Bunker Wiess. The big one is his brother, Warchild.  The other two always hang.  They think they're some kinda death squad around here.
UTAH => What's their program?
BODHI => They're punks.  Nazis.  Their brains are wired wrong.  They hurt surfing because they give nothing back, and they have no respect for the sea. They just want to get radical.  It's mindless aggression.  They'll never get it, the spiritual side of it.
UTAH => You always talk like this?  You're not gonna start chanting or anything are you?
BODHI =>  No.  So I was up the beach.  I saw it going down.  you didn't hesitate... they never backed you up an inch. That's rare in this world.
UTAH => Thanks for stepping in.
BODHI => De nada.
UTAH => Gonna be some people at my house tonight.  Maybe you can make it.
UTAH => Where?
BODHI => Come with Tyler.  She knows.
PAPPAS => Ten seconds you're out of sight. Unbelievable.
UTAH => You're losin' them.  That's right.  Two-denver-four-sam- niner-five-niner.  Late seventies Jeep.
PAPPAS => Look, if you're gonna go leavin' your piece and your shield in the car, you can damn well stay in sight.  Okay?
UTAH => Okay, Dad.
UTAH => The jeep is registered to a Bradley Wiess.  My buddy.  Guy's got quite a sheet.  Yeah, yeah... skip all that.  Gimme the greatest hits.  Misdemeanor possession of cocaine.  That's good...
UTAH => ... Felony B and E, three months in juvey.  Better.  Felony assault. Postgraduate work at Chino. Excellent.  I'm lovin' it.  What about the brother?  Great!  Another model citizen. These guys really fit the profile.
PAPPAS => Remember, all bank robbers are losers, but not all losers are bank robbers.
UTAH => These are the guys.  I can feel it. I say we lay it on Harp.
MUNOZ => This is bullshit.  This is a bullshit lead.  This is totally bullshit.  Harp must be fucking desperate if he's listening to you two flakes.
UTAH => See you bright and early, guys.
PAPPAS => Cold pizza?  It's great for breakfast.
UTAH => When did Harp say they'd have the warrant?
PAPPAS => He's pushing it through first thing. You better get some sleep tonight, it could be an interesting morning.
UTAH => Nice place.
TYLER => He rents it for the summer.  Bodhi always gets some slick place and throws it open to every surf burnout around.  Most a these guys can't keep a job.  When the swell comes, they're gone, they have to ride.
GROMMET => Do your worst, man!
head. => The crowd goes wild. BODHI stands nearby with his arm around a BEAUTIFUL WOMAN. Pleased to see Utah, he motions him over.
UTAH => Don't you gamble?
BODHI => Only make bets I can't afford to lose.  Only way to be 100% committed.
UTAH => Who's the girl?
TYLER => Catch of the day.
UTAH => Oh, oh.  That sounds personal.
TYLER => People are expendable to Bodhi.
UTAH => Meaning you were expendable.
TYLER =>  We went out for about five minutes... which is four minutes longer than most of them.  But you can't hold it against him, he's... different.
UTAH => Sure, he's "the Bodhisattva".
TYLER =>  Yeah, he thinks he's evolved to a higher plane of existence, or something.  Maybe he has.  You've seen him surf... that frenzy.  It seems like anger.  It's not.  It's the energy of lovemaking.  The sea is the woman in his life.  She's his only true lover.
UTAH => All she does is beat the shit out of me.
NATHANIEL =>  ... Okay, so you're in the face, it's twenty-five feet straight down, your balls are about this big. (like he's holding up two BB's) And the whole thing's moving, right, roaring like you're stuck to the front of a freight train.  There ain't nothin' like it, man.  The ultimate rush.  Forget about sex, it doesn't even come close.
ROACH => You lose it right then, you're history.  The fish'll be pickin' you outta the coral.
NATHANIEL =>  Thanks, brah.
ROACH => See, it's all dynamic, it's all in motion.  You can't just stop and walk on in to the beach if you don't like the way things are going, y' know what I mean?  You gotta ride it out man, all the way.
GROMMET => You ride the monsters, you gotta know you're ridin' a line between life and death.  There ain't no forgiveness.
UTAH => So what's the biggest?  Waimea?
BODHI => No, Bells Beach, Australia.
GROMMET => Shit, yeah!  I remember that day... gnarly fuckin' ass!  Was your birthday--
ROACH => The set was northwest.  Jacking up like a fucking mountain of gray glass--
BODHI => I made that one mistake you pray you'll never make--
NATHANIEL => You shoulda fuckin' seen it... it was like he fell for-ever.  Then the curl crashes down and he's gooone--
GROMMET => -- held down in the washing machine, man... it was severe, we couldn't see nothin' thought it was all over for sure--
Nathaniel HOWLS. => Tyler watches Utah watching Bodhi.  Notices how he is mesmerized by these war stories.  Bodhi smiles, unexpectedly.
BODHI => Not tragic to die doing what you love.  You want the ultimate thrill, you gotta be willing to pay the ultimate price.
NATHANIEL => Fuckin' A.
GROMMET =>  Hell, I ain't gonna see 30.
UTAH =>  Uh.  I need another beer.
house. => A kind of shrine to the Bodhisattva. Shelves filled with books and artifacts from his travels. Maori masks, a blowgun, a skeletal shark mouth two feet across, a huge fossil ammonite... an unbelievable variety of tribal artifacts and marine specimens. The books include political literature, eastern religion, philosophy.  A strange hodgepodge of titles and authors: Nietzsche, Marx, the Tao, "Steal this Book", "The Book of Five Rings", Frederick Forsyth thrillers.
TYLER => Bunch of goddamn adrenaline junkies. I hope you're not buying into this banzai-bullshit like the rest of Bodhi's moonies.
UTAH => What are you talking about?
TYLER => I've seen that kamikaze look, Johnny.  You've got it.  And Bodhi can smell it a mile away.  He'll take you to the edge... and past it. (she looks past Johnny, sees something) Hey, Bodhi.
BODHI => Johnny has his own demons, don't you, Johnny?
BODHI => Feel it?
BODHI => Gentlemen, it's time.
UTAH => What's goin' on?
TYLER => Swell's here, Johnny.  Bodhi always knows.
BODHI => Let's go, Utah.  Time for a little stealth mission.
surfers. => ROSIE hangs back with the idling vehicles, tattooed arms crossed.  He puffs on a cigarette.
ROACH =>  Gaping barrels!  Way overhead, man!
UTAH => I can barely do this in broad daylight.
TYLER => Come on.  At least no one's gonna see how bad you are.
water. => He strokes powerfully out through the black swell.
off yelling. => Johnny turns as a figure glides up next to him.
UTAH => I gotta be fucking crazy.
BODHI => Yeah, but are you crazy enough?
BODHI => Football's a man-made game.  You keep score with numbers.  But in this, there's no field, no rules, no opponent.  Just you and the wave.
UTAH => I know that part.  Tell me something I can use, here.
BODHI => I've watched you once or twice.  You surf like it's some kind of street fight.  You jerk along from moment to moment, fighting everything that comes at you.  Always trying to win.
UTAH => A flaw I'm working on.
BODHI => The only way to win out here is to surrender.  You have to feel what the wave is doing, accept its energy, get in sync.  Just feel it all moving in the blackness... you don't need to see.
UTAH => Yeah, right, vision is highly over- rated.
BODHI => This one's got your name on it, Johnny.
BODHI => Let's go.
UTAH => Shit, I'm gonna die.  I'm gonna die now.
moonlight. => Not wanting to drop too far behind, Johnny walks a little forward on the board.  The nose dips, picking up speed.
night. => Utah has a big feral grin plastered on his face. Bodhi looks back.  Gives him a thumbs up. Then he cuts left and drops giddily down to the bottom, slashing back and climbing. Utah tries it, feels the drop like freefall... feels the speed. He makes his bottom turn, nearly falling. The grin dropping off his face.
TYLER => You had enough?
UTAH => Yeah.  I just want to sit out here for a minute.
somehow childlike. => A slow grin spreads itself across his face.
TYLER => Look at you.
UTAH => What?
TYLER => Well, usually you have this sort of intense scowl of concentration, like you're doing this for a school project or something... I don't know, like something's driving you. (she puts her fingertip to  his forehead) See, it's gone.  If I didn't know better I'd say you looked almost happy.
UTAH => I... I don't know.  I can't describe what I'm feeling.
TYLER =>  You don't have to.
alongside his. => He runs his fingertips down her arm.
UTAH => Goosebumps.  Come here.
TYLER => Those are cold.
UTAH => Warm them up.
fighter". => Rosie's fire is burning low. Tyler, half-wrapped in a blanket from the car, straddles Johnny on the sand like she straddles her board.  The blanket slips down. Naked silhouettes in the firelight. She arches her back as they move together in prefect sync. Grips his shoulders and stares into his face, her teeth bared in a grimace of pleasure that looks like pain. She makes love like she does everything... with honesty and intensity. Utah, surprisingly, is gentle and slow. He strokes her hair after she collapses onto him.
light. => He bolts up, looking around.  Tyler is asleep beside him, with the quilt from the car pulled up tight to her chin. She looks radiant in sleep. He grabs his watch out of the sand and looks at it.
UTAH => Holy shit.
seat. => Running, he passes a gate.  Goes back.  Looks.
UTAH =>  You guys need any help?
COLE =>  You're late.
PAPPAS => Did that worthless punk partner of mine ever show up?
UTAH =>  Right here, partner.
PAPPAS => Good of you to join us, hotshot.  Watch it.  I told you, not on the hairs, goddammit.
UTAH => I'm ready to rock, Angelo.  Where you want me?
PAPPAS => Cole and Munoz are going in the back door.  Babbit is backing me.  So I want you at the side window by the hedge.  You're strictly backup, got it?
UTAH => Got it.
PAPPAS => Awright.  Get into position.  I'm rolling.
PAPPAS => Here Scooby!  Where are you boy? Here Scooby!!  You furball piece of shit.
hedge. => He slides quietly in below a bedroom window. He pulls out the little leather kit he tucked in his waistband.  Removes something from it.  A DENTAL MIRROR. Moving slowly, he raises it above the window sill, angling it where he can see inside.
speedmetal. => His eyes are screwed shut, and his fists pump to the beat like karate on 40,000 volts. The door to a bathroom is open, and the black-haired girl can be made out behind rippled shower glass.
FIBERGLASS => Yeah?  What?
PAPPAS => Have you seen a little dog?  Kind of a cockapoo lookin' thing.  About this big.
FIBERGLASS => No.
saying. => Bunker grabs a STEYR ASSAULT RIFLE, white knuckled, while Tone fumbles around and comes up with a .45 COLT AUTO.
UTAH =>  Babbit.  Get Angelo out of there. They're pulling out a fucking arsenal!  Babbit, you copy?  Cole? Don't let him pull his badge!
MUNOZ => Utah, say again.  What?  I can't hear jack shit over this lawnmower.  Christ.
PAPPAS => ... and the guy next door said he saw it go into your backyard.  My wife'll kill me if I lose the little bastard.  Me, I could care less. Whole house smells from it's liftin' its leg all the time...
BUNKER => Something's goin' down, man.  This ain't right.
TONE =>  No, man, it's nothin'.  It's nothin'.
BUNKER => Will you shut the fuck up!  Check the windows.  Do it!!
PAPPAS => You sure he isn't out back?  You mind if I go take a look?
FIBERGLASS => Look, I don't know anything about your dog, okay--
PAPPAS => Well is there anyone else here that might have seen him?
FIBERGLASS => There's nobody else here...
WARCHILD => There's two guys by the back door. Ducked down.
TONE => Oh, shit.  Shit!!  We're fucked, man.
BUNKER => That fat fuck comes through the door I'm gonna pump him up.  Swear to Christ, man, I'm gonna blow the dude up!
PAPPAS => FBI, gorgeous.  Now let's take a look around--
UTAH => FBI!!  DROP IT!
BLAM! => It rips the plaster next to Johnny's shoulder. Shatters the shower door behind him.  The BLACK-HAIRED GIRL screams. Johnny flinches, FIRING RAPIDLY.  Wild. Bunker drops, hit. Warchild lets go with the 12 gauge.  KABOOM! Takes a chunk like a shark bite out of the doorframe by Johnny's head. Deafening in the confined space. Johnny flattens himself behind the doorframe. Tone just splits.  Down the hall like a greyhound.
bathroom doorway. => He raises the Steyr.  Mistake.
WARCHILD => Move it, man.  Let's get the fuck out of here!
right foot. => He screams and drops to the floor. Munoz sandwiches him with the door and draws down on Warchild, who dives into a doorway. Cole drives past Munoz, who has Tone pinned, and pounds down the corridor.
Warchild. => "Freight-train" appears behind him from another door. She raises a pair of scissors and drives them into his back up to the hilt. Pulls them out, going for another stab, when-- Pappas spins her around and slams her face-first into the wall.
of vision. => On pure instinct, he kicks into overdrive.  Johnny leaps the bed and goes ballistic.  His flying tackle catches Warchild at the window.
bull. => Bleeding from superficial lacerations, Warchild plows through the hedge. Johnny dives after him. The Polyester Neighbor stands paralyzed as the two crazed figures careen toward him.  He is knocked flying, and the ROARING LAWNMOWER is flipped onto its side.
the rotor. => Warchild puts all his weight on Johnny. Pushing him face-first toward the blades. Johnny feels the wind on his face. The engine is roaring, full throttle.
shattered. => The rotor spins to a stop. Warchild looks up into the black eye of Pappas' gun. Two inched from his face.
PAPPAS => Speak into the microphone.
PAPPAS => It's always been lasers and paper targets until today, right?
PAPPAS => No difference, Utah.  Just a little more to clean up. (squeezes the rookie's  shoulder) It's alright.  You did good today.
PAPPAS => Oh shit.
window. => THWAAAAAP!!  The two taped packets slam the wall inches from Utah's right ear.  Johnny snaps his head around. Stares into the face of DIETZ who looks like Warchild's meaner brother. And he's pissed as hell...
DIETZ => You know what this is?!  Two keys uncut crystal meth!
UTAH => What the hell's your problem?
DIETZ => You think I like this haircut?  My wife wants me to stay at Ramada -- I been working on these guys for THREE MONTHS!  Finally -- finally--  -- I get dickwad in there wantin' to play wheel of fortune so I can find out their supplier!
HARP => This is agent Dietz, DEA.  He's got a record of your suspect's movements every day for the last three months.
DIETZ =>  All I wanna know is how are these guys supposed to be holding up Tarzana City National on August 2nd, when they are in Fort-fucking- Lauderdale August 2ND!!!
HARP => Not an easy thing to do, is it, Utah?
UTAH => Aw shit.
PAPPAS => Nice tattoo, Dietz.
BODHI => C'mon brah, there's a righteous swell.  Let's go!  Let's go!
TYLER => He does this.
TYLER => Come on, Utah.  Everybody's out there catchin' all the good rides.
TYLER => What's wrong Johnny?  You're like a different person.
UTAH => I am a different person, Tyler.
mist. => FIGURES APPEAR, faint silhouettes in the fog. Shades of gray in the gray. IN SLOW MOTION they weave hypnotically across the screen, their shapes merging and unmerging as they cross each other.
Dolphins playing. => Challenging each other in mock combat. So good, their boards slash past each other with inches to spare. There is an incredible sense of freedom and exhilaration. Bonding forged through mastery of this arcane art. For the first time we see the core group of Bodhi's tribe, by themselves.  It dawns on us... There are four of them. And at that moment Nathaniel drops in front of Bodhi, laughing at the near miss, and drops his pants in a nasty wig-wagging moon.
TYLER => Hey.  You okay?  You look like you saw a ghost.
PAPPAS => Forget about it, kid, They're ghosts...
UTAH => I... I gotta go.
TYLER => Johnny... what's going on?  I don't get it... did I do something?
UTAH => No.  I'm sorry.  I have to go. I'll, uh... I'll call you later. I'm sorry.
PAPPAS => Hey, babe.  Get on over here so the big dog can teach ya how to bark.
UTAH => Woof, woof.
PAPPAS => Johnny!  Uh, you, uh... should call first, you know?  Hey, where the hell were you all day?  You gotta at least call in or something.  You okay?
UTAH => Angelo, we gotta talk.
PAPPAS => Listen, uh... if you're okay, can it wait till tomorrow morning, kid, I...
MISS DEER => Angie, they didn't have the kind of wine you like but I got... oh, hi Johnny!
UTAH => ... so I started tailing him.
PAPPAS => This Zen master surfer.
UTAH => Bodhi, yeah.  I'm on him all day, right.  He goes here, he goes there, he goes to Tower Records and buys come CDs, he has lunch at Patrick's Road House...  ... he goes into the Assured Trust Savings and Loan.
PAPPAS => Did he rob it?
UTAH => Cute.  He was inside for about 20 minutes.  The other guy, Roach, waited in the truck.  They were scoping it out, right?!
UTAH => Yeah, or cashing a check.
UTAH => Wait, wait.  Then these guys go back to their beach house and box up all their shit.  Load it in Bodhi's truck and take it to a public storage unit.  You see?  Summer's almost over.  They're splitting. They're gonna pick up a little traveling money tomorrow.  The next day at the outside latest.  I got a feeling.
PAPPAS => Last time you got a feeling I had to kill a man, which I always hate because it looks bad on the report.
UTAH => Angelo... I'm right this time.  We can still win this one.
PAPPAS => Alright, look... banks are closed. Nothing's gonna go down tonight, right?  So we'll be on these guys like white on rice... first thing tomorrow morning.  Okay?  Tomorrow. Okay?
UTAH => Woof, woof.
UTAH => They're gone.  Son of a bitch.  We missed them.
PAPPAS => They're on their way to Maui.
UTAH => No way.  Not yet.  Come on.
PAPPAS => Jesus Christ, kid!  The banks don't open 'till nine.
UTAH => I say we call it in.  Get some backup.  But you gotta do it.  Harp won't listen to me.
PAPPAS => Sure.  No problem.  I'll just call up and tell him his favorite agent saw this one surfer moon another surfer yesterday and it looked real suspicious.  Shit, he'll probably call out the National Guard.
UTAH => I say we don't call it in.  Under no circumstance are we to call this in.
PAPPAS => Look, we handle it ourselves, for right now, okay?  We cover the bank, whatever.  You and me.  That way if nothing happens, or more accurately, when nothing happens... I don't get my tits any further into the wringer than they already are.
PAPPAS => Time for lunch.
UTAH => Angelo, it's eleven thirty.
PAPPAS => That place up the street has meatball sandwiches.  Get me two.
his sunglasses. => He trudges off through the sidewalk crowd toward the FAST- FOOD STAND nearby. Pappas pulls the sports page back up to block the sun.
visible B.G. => The pick-up window opens and food appears, sliding out. Utah turns, pulling out his wallet.
open. => The Ex-Presidents jump out. They sprint for the entrance.  All this OUT OF FOCUS, B.G. Johnny misses it as he picks up the food order. The Presidents disappear inside. Johnny looks toward the bank again.  There is no movement.
UTAH => Here, yours is the one that looks like a road kill.  Enjoy.
UTAH => Here's your lemonade. (he looks down the street) Did you see that T-Bird pull up?
PAPPAS =>  Damn, I could eat the ass out of an elephant.  I shoulda had you get me three a these.  What T-Bird?
to him. => He looks at it.  Picks it up.  Pops it into his mouth and-- Freezes, mouth open.  Eyes focused on... The Ex-Presidents, in living color, flashing through the doors of the bank 80 feet away.
PAPPAS => Jesus Christ!!  It's them!
UTAH => FBI!!  Freeze!!  Right now!
Utah FIRES. => BLAM!  BLAM!  BLAM! He puts two into the trunk and blows the back window into junk jewelry.  The T-Bird peels out into traffic, clipping a Subaru which locks them up and spins.
PAPPAS => Come on, kid, get in the car! Jesus!
traffic. => Their sedan slews around the back of an eighteen wheeler, fishtailing.  It straightens out.  No T-Bird in sight.
UTAH => The hell are they?!
PAPPAS => They took a left at the next light!
UTAH => You sure?!
UTAH => I got 'em.  I see 'em.  I'm on it, I'm on it.
PAPPAS => You even watching the road?
LBJ => Where are they, man?  I don't see 'em.  We lose 'em?
undercarriage. => An instant later it hammers into the side of the T-Bird.
broadside. => The sedan flips onto its back in an explosion of glass. SCREECH of steel on concrete as it comes to rest. Hanging upside down, Pappas is mightily pissed off.
PAPPAS => Nice fuckin' work, hotshot. Christ!
REAGAN => Emergency sanitization!  Here we go!
flame. => Then pulls the trigger on the nozzle.
NIXON => Let's go!  Move it, Ronny!
out. => A recent President and a wild-eyed cop trailing smoke like a crashing jet fighter.
gaining. => Utah has become an engine, a running machine... juggernaut mode.
knows-what. => He runs through a Mr. Turtle Pool in an explosion of spray. Crashes through a hedge. Through the narrow gap between houses. Utah powers into the tight space behind him. Blurring along between stucco walls.
falls down. => Reagan and Utah both hurdle her.
teenagers. => He comes out of a pile-up somehow still in high gear.
brakes. => It stops so fast, one of the guys falls off the back. The GUY is getting up as Utah whips around the back of the truck. Knocks him sprawling. Utah doesn't stop.  Doesn't look back. Like he doesn't see anything in the real world but the figure running ahead of him.  Like it's some kind of hyperkinetic video game.
impressions. => The house across the street is blocked by fence on both sides. A MAN is picking up his mail. Reagan pounds past him.  Right through the front door of the house. Utah follows.
crashing everywhere. => He sprints down a hallway after Reagan. A FIERCE WOMAN in a housecoat shouting at them as they pass, holding a vacuum cleaner like it's shot-gun.
WOMAN => Get the fuck out of this house! What the fuck do you think you're doing--
it. => Reagan has thrown a PIT-BULL. The Fierce Woman's fierce dog.
yard. => Sprinklers this time.  Reagan and Utah running through sunlit walls of rain.  They crash through another hedge. Emerging drenched.
pavement below. => Reagan falls, landing on his feet. Panting now, feeling it, he stumbles up and runs on.
lawnmower. => Slides over the edge.  Falls -- lands hard.
UTAH => Not now.  Not now!
REAGAN => You want me, there's only one way.
his knee. => His face is a nasty patchwork of scratches and bruises. He drains his coffee and gazes out at the empty bullpen.
PAPPAS => Nothing?
UTAH => Nothing.
PAPPAS => Go home, kid.  Get the hell outta here.  Get some sleep.  You look like shit.  They get anything even resembles your guy, I'm on your beeper.  Here.  You like feta?
UTAH => Feta.  My favorite.
PAPPAS => Johnny...
PAPPAS => All I wanna know is one thing, why didn't you just take the shot?
UTAH => I don't know.
UTAH => Ouch.
TYLER => Betadyne doesn't hurt.
UTAH => You're kneeling on my hand.
TYLER => So what'd the other guy look like?
UTAH => Never saw him, was your basic hit and run.
TYLER => But you look like you been in a train wreck, how'd he just drive away?
TYLER => Johnny, what is it with you?  You have that look again, it's like you're about to tell me something and then you don't... or you can't. What's going on?
TYLER => What?  What do you want to tell me?
UTAH => I'm glad you pulled me out of the water that day...
agape. => TYLER stands above him, recovering from the kick of the smoking 9mm Beretta in her hand.
TYLER => A lawyer!?  You lied to me!
TYLER => Look, Tyler, I can--
TYLER => Jesus Christ, Johnny -- you've been using me!  Your jacket's on the floor in the bathroom -- this goddamn thing's half out of the pocket... Oh God, it's all part of some case, isn't it?
UTAH => Tyler, put the gun down.
TYLER => You tell me the fucking truth Johnny... did your parents really die in a car crash?  DID THEY?!
UTAH => No.  They live in Columbus Ohio.
UTAH => I work bank robbery.  Guys I'm after are surfers.  I needed you, at first, but not--
TYLER => Fuck you, Johnny Utah.  Fuck you!! Don't you have a soul?  Goddamn you to hell!
UTAH => Tyler!  Wait!!
screeching away. => Utah sags, the breath coming out of him long and slow.
TYLER => Hi, it's me.  Leave a message.
UTAH => Tyler I... look, I fucked up, okay. I know I fucked up.  I wanted to tell you, but I couldn't -- I was afraid you'd leave... good guess, huh?  Fuck, why can't I ever say what I really mean?  I lied to you.  I'm an asshole... but I need you, Tyler.  I want you to know that I've never known anyone like you before in my life... and I... I hope you change your mind...
UTAH => Tyler!  Wait, I--
BODHI => Howdy brah.
BODHI => C'mon, get your gear on, we're rollin'.
sight. => He palms it when Bodhi is turned away, and slips it into his hip pocket to conceal it.
UTAH => What going on, Bodhi?
BODHI => Here. (spying Johnny's cut face) Hey, what happened?  Ya cut yourself shaving?
UTAH => I don't think I wanna surf right now.
BODHI => Naw, this is different, Johnny. This is something totally different... you're gonna love this.
BODHI => C'mon, let's go, let's go.  Time's wastin', brah.
BODHI => Life's sure got a sick sense of humor, don't you think so Johnny?
UTAH => How you figure?
BODHI =>  News, last night... those guys, the Ex-Presidents... they robbed my bank yesterday.  And I was just there the day before, cashing a check.  See... look.  Assured Trust... same place.
Johnny. => Utah opens the cover and looks. Sure enough.  Assured Trust Savings and Loan.
BODHI => I was picking up some bucks cause we're leaving town.  Bizarre, huh? If I'd waited a day I'd been right in the middle of it.  Kinda sorry I missed it.  I'd liked to've seen them.
UTAH => Takes guts to rob a bank.  All that adrenalin pumping, waving loaded guns, taking out the guards, getting everybody on the floor, never knowin' who's gonna burst in... (looks right at Bodhi) ... wondering what it's like to take a bullet.  Must be some ride.
BODHI => Banks are insured, brah.  Long as nobody gets shot, it's really a victimless crime.  Just gotta scare 'em a little, would be my guess.  Now if I was gonna rob a bank, with all those guys wearin' body armor these days, know what I'd carry?
BODHI => .454 Casull.  Most powerful handgun on the planet.  Muzzle velocity of 2000 feet per second.  Twice the kinetic energy of a .44 Magnum.
UTAH => One shot stopping.
BODHI =>  'One shot stopping'... good, very good.  I like you, Johnny.  I like you because you'll sacrifice anything to win.  I respect that. It elevates you a little above the drones who have learned compromise. Here, hold it.  Check out the weight.
to Utah. => Johnny takes it slowly.  Now it's aimed at Bodhi.
BODHI =>  Whoa.  Careful.  You got the muzzle pointing right at me, brah.
highway. => Johnny swings a stiff arm out his window and pumps a ROUND into open desert.  KABOOOM!!  The recoil blows Johnny's arm back over the top of the truck.  Practically breaks his wrist. Thunder rolls across the dark hills. From the back of the pickup Nathaniel howls. Grommet and Roach high five.
UTAH => Nice.
BODHI => It's a special day, Johnny U.  A very special day...
BODHI => Ever done this before?
UTAH => Once.
BODHI => Pure adrenalin, right?!  The ultimate rush.  Other guys snort for it, jab a vein for it -- all you gotta do is jump.
UTAH => Sure, it's a blast, but listen, I sorta screwed up my knee yesterday--
BODHI => Yeah, I noticed you limping.  But don't worry about it, brah. Don't worry at all.  We're not gonna land on land!
UTAH => Oh, well, that's fine then.  I feel so much better.
jump barefoot. => Nobody has their chutes on yet. Johnny hefts his, as if weighing it, somehow judging the contents.  His brain is racing.  Bodhi shouts over the roar.
BODHI => It's a little ceremony we always have at the end of summer.  One last speedstar.
UTAH => So, who... uh, who packed my chute?
BODHI => I did.  What's the matter?  Don't trust me?
UTAH => You gotta earn trust.
BODHI => Then we'll earn it together.  Here, take mine.
ROACH => Hey... you don't want Bodhi's, man. His pack-jobs suck... they only open half the time.  Take Grommet's, man.
GROMMET => Whoa, unfair, dude!
grinning faces. => Russian surfer freefall roulette.  Shit. Bodhi studying him.  Some kind of test. Fuck it.  Utah starts putting the damn thing on.
UTAH => We gonna jump or jerk off?
BODHI => My man!
BODHI => Utah, you copy bruddah?
UTAH => Whoooaaah!  Shhiiittt!  Whoooaaah!
BODHI => I'll take that as a yes.
ROACH => Whip it out dudes!  Cheap sex with the cosmos!
BODHI => Ten thousand feet.  Let's do it.
BODHI => Come on Johnny.  Get in here!
BODHI => Relax, brah.  I got you, I got you.
GROMMET => Righteous-ass speedstar, dudes!
BODHI => You diggin' this?
UTAH => Great!  GREAT!
BODHI => Purty-thirty and we're meat waffles, folks.  See ya downtown!
drifting apart. => Bodhi stays with Utah, falling parallel to the horizon, facing each other, holding hands.  4000 feet.  Airspeed
disappearing. => Bodhi and Utah fall on, alone.
BODHI => You gonna pull?
UTAH => After you, Alfonse.  I insist!
BODHI => Don't screw around man, pull it!
UTAH => You do it... you first!
BODHI => One thousand feet.  Pull the goddamn cord!
UTAH => You first!
BODHI => Okay!
handle. => He waves goodbye as Johnny's canopy deploys.  Utah is jerked upward.  He feels his weight hanging brutally in the harness. Johnny looks down. Impossibly close to the ground.  Bodhi's canopy BURSTS OUT, an explosion of color.  Below him is the shimmering mirror of a LARGE RESERVOIR.  Two seconds later the bright yellow canopy meets its reflection and goes slack.  An explosion of white water marks Bodhi's impact.
skyward. => Molten glass falling back in the bright desert dawn. Utah surfaces, sputtering, and shucks out of the harness. He floats like a jellyfish, gasping for breath.
UTAH => Jesus Christ.  I gotta be losin' it.
walk up. => They're all soaked and stoked.
BODHI => Ya see... I told you Johnny U was gonna be just fine!
BODHI => C'mere.  There's something you need to see.
UTAH => What's this?
BODHI => Insurance policy.  Now this is going to sting a bit, but it's for your own growth, brah.  Press play.
viciously. => He controls her efficiently. Bodhi stops the tape.
BODHI => She's a wild one, isn't she... Special Agent Utah?
UTAH => You're a fucking dead man--
BODHI =>  Whoa, whoa!!  Think it through!  I'm the only one knows where they are. Just let me talk for a second.
UTAH => Talk.
BODHI => She'll be fine, Rosie won't do anything.  At least not as long as I meet him at a certain place and time, about... let's see... (he looks at his dive Rolex) ... six hours from now.
UTAH => You call him... right now... and tell him to let her go.
BODHI => Sorry, can't do it, brah.  He's on the road.  And where they're going there's no phones.  Damn, I hate this Johnny, I really do.  I hate violence.  See, that's why I need Rosie.  I could never make this thing work, myself.  No way I could hold a knife to Tyler's throat, man! She was my woman, once.  We shared time in this world.  But Rosie, he's kind of a... mechanism.  Once you set him in motion, he won't stop. That's his gift, a kind of... blankness.  Noon comes, straight up, he'll gut her like a pig and try not to get any on his shoes.  Nothing I can do, unless I get there.
BODHI => So that makes us partners, doesn't it?  Because now we both have the same goal... to get me where I need to go.  Right?
UTAH => We're wasting time.
BODHI => See!  That's what I like about you, man!  You're just sharp as a razor blade.
BODHI => Get the plane down to Santa Monica and top up the tanks.  Let's go.  Let's saddle up!
BODHI => Okay.  All I'm askin' for is ninety seconds of your life, Johnny. That's all.
BODHI => It's basic dog psychology, brah.  If you scare them, get them pissing down their leg, they submit... you control them.  If you project weakness, you draw aggression... that's how people get hurt.
Roach. => Nathaniel and Grommet sit up front. The duffels contents are strewn around.  Masks.  Weapons. They're all pulling on suit pants and jackets.  Tying ties.  Slipping on white gloves.  Snappy Oxfords. Bodhi is pulling a suit jacket on over his BODY ARMOR. Utah is fumbling with his armored vest.  He works with vicious, jerky moves.  His jaw locked.  Eyes down.
BODHI => Fear causes hesitation, and hesitation will cause your worst fears to come true.  You project strength to avoid conflict.
ROACH => Peace through superior firepower, babe.
GAUGE. => Pockets the shells.  Tosses the weapon to Utah.
BODHI => Here, you need this.  You can't be comin' through that door with your dick in your hands, right?
UTAH => I can't do this.
BODHI => Sure you can!  You may even like it... it's a killer rush.  You'll see.  Hey, don't I show you things, Johnny U?
UTAH => Bodhi, this is your wake up call, man -- I... am... an... Eff... Bee... Eye... Agent!!
BODHI => Wild, ain't it?!  See, we exist on a higher plane, you and I.  We make our own rules.  Why be a servant of the law Johnny U... when you can be it's master?
GROMMET => Fuckin' A!
BODHI => Ninety seconds, man, door to door. A small price to pay for someone who loves you.  She does you know.  It's not her style to fall so hard... I don't think she did with me.
BODHI => Sorry, Johnny.  Guess you don't get to be president.
BODHI => Rock and roll!
gut. => Someone screams.
BODHI => Everybody freeze!!  Don't move!!
GROMMET => Don't fucking do it, man!
BODHI/REAGAN => All Tellers back away from the counter!  Hands on your heads! RIGHT NOW!!  That's right.  You know the drill.
BODHI/REAGAN => All customers on the floor.  Let's go!  Move it!  Get down!  On the floor!  Right now!  Let's go.
UTAH => On the floor, asshole!  What's your problem?!  I blow your fucking kneecaps out, you'll be on the floor!!
BODHI/REAGAN => Kick in the ass, ain't it?  Gonna be kinda hard to explain though... when they play the tapes back down at the bureau.  Could look bad on your monthly evaluation.
UTAH => Can we just get the goddamn money and get out of here?!
BODHI/REAGAN => That's the spirit!!  Head's down!  Eyes down!  Just a couple minutes of your life and we're gone.
plan. => Roach isn't going for the drawers... he's sprinting for the VAULT.
BODHI/REAGAN => You!  Miss Jennings... of New Accounts. Be a dear and open the inner gate for my associate.  NOW!!
MISS JENNINGS => He -- he -- he has the keys.  Mr. Duggan.
BODHI/REAGAN => Whatta say, Mr. Duggan?  Wanna give her the keys or do I pick through the blood and chunks for them?
DUGGAN => Do whatever they say, Terry.
his eye. => The guard, face jammed against the linoleum, blanches as he sees the customer lift a corner of his shirt to reveal THE BUTT OF A PISTOL.  The customer mouths the words "I'm a cop". The guard is hyperventilating.
sunlight. => JFK pulls her in fast and throws her to the floor.  Then goes back to watching the street.
UTAH => You're blowing it, man!  You're breaking your own rules... pulling too much time!
BODHI/REAGAN => JFK, how we doin'?
NATHANIEL/JFK => All clear, man!
his body. => He signals with his eyes to the fat guard, glancing at the guard's ankle.
holster. => REAGAN spins. The cop FIRES.  BLAM! Reagan is catapulted backward off the counter by the impact. He crashes onto a desk on his back.  Slides off, scattering papers. A teller screams.  The cop spins toward Utah. Johnny throws down the shotgun.  Shows his palms.  He's holding out his gold star.
UTAH => Federal agent!  Undercover!
BLAM!!! => All of them wild, but serving to get Nathaniel pinned down behind a check-writing island.
BODHI => Don't anybody fucking move!
knees. => Beneath LBJ's stony countenance a river of blood flows down Grommet's chest.  Roach pulls off the mask. Revealing a terrified kid. Grommet pulls his blood-drenched hand away from his throat, stares at it bug-eyed.
GROMMET => Oh no, oh my god, oh god... it's all comin' out man, gotta stop it... it's all gonna come out... do something!!
work. => A paste-white frightened kid.  Eighteen years old. Suddenly realizing that this is not some video game.  That death is real. He slumps back, losing the battle for consciousness. WE HEAR SIRENS APPROACHING.
ROACH =>  We gotta bug out, man!  We're eatin' it bad on this one.  Let's go!
the floor. => He considers it for a long time.  Then looks up at Johnny. His eyes seem to ask for forgiveness... A moment before he smashes the Casull into Johnny's skull.
BODHI => Goodbye, Johnny.
MUNOZ => -- if you so desire, an attorney will be provided for you free of cost.  Do you understand these rights I have explained to you? Utah?
PAPPAS => He knows his goddamn rights!  Jesus, kid.  I knew you were getting too close to these guys. (turns to the other agents) Gimme the goddamn key to these things, Cole.  Christ!
wrists. => Cole hands him the key. Harp storms toward them.
HARP => Don't take those off.  Just leave them on!  Your partner's an accessory to murder.  You realize that?
in death. => He was right about not making thirty.
HARP => Three men dead.  One of them a cop. How's that sit in your gut, Utah?
UTAH =>  Take your hand off my shoulder right now.
PAPPAS => Look, Harp.  Don't turn him over to the uniforms like some punk.  Let me ride him in.
HARP => Yeah, sure.  Why not?  You two screw-ups deserve each other. That's why I put you together in the first place.  Christ Pappas, you're as bad as he is... talk about the blind leading the blind--
PAPPAS => Harp, let me tell you something.  I was an agent in this bureau when your mommy was still wiping your shinny pink ass, and you know one thing I learned in all those years that you still haven't?
HARP => What that?
PAPPAS => Respect your elders. (he takes Utah by the arm) Let's go kid.
side. => Utah in disgrace.  Contrite.  Stony.  Finally...
UTAH => I know where they're going.
PAPPAS => Figured you did.
UTAH => Only problem is... we can't arrest them or shoot them.
aircraft. => Utah slides behind the wheel and drives on.
UTAH => I'm not armed.
BODHI => But you're not alone.
UTAH => Good guess.  There's a gun on you right now.
UTAH => Where's Roach?
BODHI => Around somewhere.  Listen, I'm in kind of a hurry, Johnny U.  What can I do for you?
UTAH => You gotta tell me where she is.
BODHI => And let my policy expire?  Sorry.
UTAH => Look, Bodhi man.  People are dead. The ride is over.
BODHI => I say when it's over!
UTAH => The guy you killed was an off duty cop!  If you get out of here they'll nail you wherever you land.  They have a new thing called radar. Maybe you've heard of it.
UTAH => I know you man, when they fall on you, you won't back down.  They'll have to burn your ass to the ground. And I can't stop them... I'm the last person they're ready to listen to right now.  Thanks to you.
UTAH => Shit may or may not happen.
UTAH => Look, you got a death wish, you want to ride to glory... fine!  But don't take her with you, man.  I'm begging you... tell me where she is.  Then I walk away.  We've earned that much trust, haven't we?
BODHI =>  Back in the hotseat, campadre. NOW!
BAM!  BAM! => Roach flips onto his back. The shotgun blows a hole in the sky as he hits the deck. Pappas is on the ground, totally exposed, 20 feet from the others.
UTAH => Angelo!  Don't fire!
PAPPAS => Kid, get outta the way!!
UTAH => NOOO!!
shotgun. => Standoff.
PAPPAS => GODDAMMIT!!
scarlet. => He cocks another round into the chamber and fires again. BOOM!
UTAH => NNNOOOOOO!!!
PILOT => I ain't flyin' you guys to San Phillipe man, forget it.  Not now--
BODHI => Thanks for telling the nice FBI agent where we're going.
ROACH => Get in the fucking plane.
BODHI => We're gonna ride this out, all the way, Johnny.  You and me.  Let's go.
canyons. => As close to the earth as the terrified pilot will take it. Under the radar.
banks wildly. => Bodhi has the Casull aimed at the base of his skull from the jump seat just behind him. Roach holds the shotgun on Utah, seated across from him in the rear seats. Roach is a pale, sweaty mask.  He is propped against a bulkhead, seemingly collapsed in on himself like a discarded coat. His entire shirtfront and lap are slick with blood. But his gaze is steady, and the shotgun is aimed into Utah's guts. No one talks or moves on this grim hell-ride.
PILOT => Look, we been in Mexico the last half hour... can I quit mowing the lawn here or what?  I'm getting more brush in the wheels than I usually like, you know what I'm saying?!
BODHI => Yeah, get some height.  Take her up to eight thousand on this heading.
ROACH => We're gonna pop up on their screens.
BODHI => Doesn't matter now.  We're almost there, man.  Here, let me help you get your gear on.
ROACH => I'm cold.
BODHI => You're gonna be fine.  Just fine. Johnny, toss me that money bag will you.  Easy does it.
UTAH => You're cold because all the blood is running out of your body, Roach. You're going to be dead soon.  I hope it was worth it.
BODHI => Hey, Johnny's just trying to psych you man, forget it.  Just keep thinking about all those senoritas nursin' you back to health.  Come on, amigo, let's get you set for the jump.
BODHI => Rosie, Rosie, this is Air Force One, do you copy, over?
ROSIE => Copy you, Air Force One.  We have a visual on you.  Lookin' fine.
UTAH => Tell him to release Tyler.
BODHI => Why should I?
UTAH => What if your chute fails, Bodhi? Rescind the order.  Let her off the hook, she's served her purpose.  Do it, man, you owe me that much.  Let me hear it before you check out.
BODHI => Rosie, listen carefully.  Surgery is canceled, is that clear?  Repeat it back to me.
ROSIE => Copy you.  Surgery is canceled. I'm lettin' the bitch go.
at him. => Johnny stares back at him like a pit viper.
BODHI => I know it's hard for you Johnny. You want me so bad it's like acid in your mouth.  But not his time. (he braces Roach at the door) Let's go.
BODHI => You lose, campadre.
bails. => Bodhi tumbles out into space.  It's over.
UTAH => FUCK IT!!!
closes. => Utah is almost blinded by the windstream.  His eyes burn. His lips are peeled back by the blasting air. Bodhi is eighty feet below him... 4000 feet to terra firma. Utah focuses all his incredible will and concentration. He's only going to have one shot at this. Bodhi is right below him. Utah is closing like a SAM missile. He trims a little, and... WHAM!  Slams into Bodhi in a mid-air tackle.
together. => Utah has made the grab and locked his arms around Bodhi in an iron grip. He pulls the Casull's muzzle up to Bodhi's head and screams in his face.
UTAH => Pull the parachute!!
BODHI => Pretty radical, Johnny.  Even for you.  Why don't you pull it?
UTAH => No games, Bodhi.  Pull the cord! Now!!
BODHI => Naw, you pull it!
BODHI => Go on, Johnny.  Pull it.  But you gotta drop the gun, first!  Right?! You use your other hand what you gonna hold on with?
UTAH => Pull it right now or I'll blow your fucking head off and pull it myself!
BODHI => Well that's the only way it's gonna happen, man.  Do it!  Come on, you want to do it.  You're gonna die, Johnny.  Five more seconds.  Four...
UTAH => You fucking crazy!?  Pull it!!
the edge. => Bodhi's eyes are wild.  A gleeful, adrenalized madness... his pupils are the entrance to Hell.
BODHI => Three seconds... two... one...
UTAH => SHIT!!
out. => Full and round and bright red. The ground roars at us. WHAP!  Utah and Bodhi hit.  Hard.
Mexican desert. => Bodhi staggers to his feet and grins at him.
BODHI => Wild ride, huh?
UTAH =>  Jesus Christ, Bodhi!
BODHI => That pesky knee, huh?  Too bad.
BODHI => You had me worried there, for a second, Johnny U.
blood. => He gives her a wan version of the Johnny Utah grin.
storm sky. => Wind whips sand across the narrow beach-road, throwing it against the front doors of the LIGHTHOUSE PUB. TITLE OVER: ONE YEAR LATER...
BARTENDER => Gonna close early today, mate, 'fore the bloody storm hits.
UTAH => Storm's already here... It's bringing me the swell.
TYLER => John, they're here.
LIEUTENANT => D'you see him, Mr. Utah?
UTAH => No.  But he's here.
LIEUTENANT => Now, look, I know you used to be a federal agent up in the states and all that, but you're a citizen now, so just find him and we'll handle it from there.
UTAH => No problem.  Just give me a couple minutes with him first.
1ST SURFER => Jesus Almighty, the bloody sand's shakin'.
2ND SURFER => Totally closed-out.  It's fuckin' death on a stick.
UTAH => I knew you wouldn't miss the fifty year storm, Bodhi.
BODHI => And I always knew I could count on you, Agent Utah.
UTAH => I'm not FBI anymore.
BODHI => You never were...
UTAH => I asked them to give me a couple minutes...
BODHI => It went bad, brah.  Real bad.  I just felt it was time...
BODHI => Time to dance with the universe.  I could never handle a jail cell. You'll do this for me, won't you Johnny?  Haven't I earned this much?
longboard. => He half smiles, then turns toward the water, and starts walking. He stops.  Turns around.
BODHI => Thanks, brah.
UTAH => He rode it all the way.
