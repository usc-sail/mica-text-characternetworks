In "The Secret" we talk about the law of attraction and we want to be careful about the people we surround ourselves with because we become the average of those people. So we're going to make a visual board of people who are demonstrating good character, like Angelina Jolie. So what are some qualities you admire about her?
SAM => Her husband.
LAURIE => Ok. What else?
NICKI => Her hot bod.
LAURIE => Ok, the bod is not a characteristic.
NICKI => How long do we have to do this for?

LAURIE => Who is it?
NICKI => Water delivery.
LAURIE => Ok, back to work.

LAURIE => Oh, what's it called?
NICKI => I don't remember.
SAM => Something -international?
EMILY => Mom, can I be excused?

ROB => She's so messy.
MARC => I know, right?
ROB => Here we go.
SAM => Oh, shit.
ROB => C'mon, let's get the fuck out of here.
MARC => Or you could wear the Chloe sandals with this.
NICKI => Oh, yeah.
REBECCA => Turn on KTLA.
MARC => What?
REBECCA => Now.
MARC => No fucking way, no fucking way.
REBECCA => Calm the fuck down, they can't tell who it is.
MARC => Oh my god.
NICKI => Oh, shit. REBECCA It's fine, it's fine, you can't see who it is.
NEWSCASTER => Audrina Patridge posted this on her web site, asking for anyone who has any information about the break-in to contact police at the number below.
MARC => Oh my god.
MARC => Oh shit.
MR. HALL => Is everything alright in there?
NICKI => Yes, Mr. Hall, sorry if we're making too much noise.
MARC => Everything's fine.
MR. HALL => OK.
CHLOE => I'll probably go over to Sagebrush later...
REBECCA => Cool, who's playing?
CHLOE => I don't know, I think some local bands...
REBECCA => I want to go to Rachel Bilson's, she's in Paris for fashion week.
CHLOE => Don't you think you should chill out a little bit?
MARC => Yeah, that news thing totally freaked me out.
REBECCA => Nothing happened, there's no way you can tell who that is...C'mon, will you find her house for me, please?
REBECCA => I want some Chanel...
MARC => I don't know.
REBECCA => C'mon, you're my best friend, please. Let's go get some stuff.
REBECCA => We're going to Rachel Bilson's, wanna come?
NICKI => Hells yeah, text me where...is she still dating Hayden Christensen?
REBECCA => I don't know.
REBECCA => Marc thinks so.
REBECCA => C'mon.
MARC => What if there are cameras?
REBECCA => There aren't, just keep your hat on...and chill out. It's fine.
SAM => She has so many Chanel bags.
NICKI => I love this one!
SAM => That's so cute.
MARC => What are you doing in there?
REBECCA => When you have to go, you have to go. MARC Are you fucking crazy? How are you so relaxed?

MARC => That was fucked up.
NICKI => I know!
NICKI => Look a Mademoiselle bag! How cute is this?!
SAM => That's so cute. Did you get me one?
MARC => I think the biggest problem was after the Audrina thing-nothing happened-it gave Rebecca that self- boost that, oh, this is okay. I can get away with this. And I think her projecting that onto me made me think that it was going to be okay.
DRUNK GIRL => Yo, Becca.
REBECCA => Yo.
DRUNK GIRL => I heard you went to Paris Hilton's.

PARTY GIRL => Shut the fuck up.
MARC => Rebecca's like biggest conquest was Lindsay Lohan. She was her ultimate fashion icon.
CHLOE => I'm staying on look out.
MARC => I don't think we should do this. If there are cameras, it's gonna be like Audrina's, it's gonna get out.
REBECCA => C'mon, Lindsay's gone, I wanna do this, this is our opportunity.
REBECCA => Let's just go, no one's here, you're on camera, but it doesn't matter, you'll be fine, Audrina's was fine...C'mon Marc- pretty please...
MARC => OK, but this is it.
MARC => I don't know, I think we should get out of here.
REBECCA => You're already here. You might as well come up and get something for yourself.

MARC => Yeah, sure.
KATE => Why do you think Rebecca was so obsessed with these women and their clothes - enough to steal?
MARC => I just think she wanted to be part of, like, the lifestyle. Like, the lifestyle that everybody kind of wants.
DRUNK GIRL => Marc and Rebecca were bragging about it at a party, they said they had been in Rachel Bilson's house and Lindsay Lohan's. They said they went to Paris Hilton's like eight times...

RICKY => What the fuck, man...
MARC => We knew he was out of town through the internet, you'd google his name and see "Orlando Bloom is shooting a movie, he's with Miranda Kerr in New York." We walked in, it was unlocked, there was no alarm.
DETECTIVE => The door was unlocked?
MARC => Yeah, I've never even broken a window.
DETECTIVE => How did you find the Rolexes?
MARC => We found a safe at the bottom of a closet with the Rolexes and like five thousand dollars...I'll give everything back that I still have, and I'll find a way to repay them, I'm really sorry about what I did.
DETECTIVE => Did you know Rebecca was leaving the state?
MARC => I just thought she was going to stay at her dad's cause she wasn't getting along with her mom and step dad. DETECTIVE You didn't know she was crossing state lines with stolen property, and leaving you holding the bag?
MARC =>  I thought she was just visiting her dad.
DETECTIVE => We have a warrant to search the premises. Are you Rebecca Ahn?
REBECCA => Yes.
DETECTIVE => Do you understand your rights?
REBECCA => Yes.
DETECTIVE => Do you know why we're at your home serving a search warrant?
REBECCA => Yes.
DETECTIVE => Why do you think we're here?
REBECCA => My friend Marc was arrested and he                  * called me from jail and told me the police had done a search warrant at his home.
DETECTIVE => Do you know why?
REBECCA => I've been watching TMZ and they've been saying I'm a `person of interest' in these burglaries.
DETECTIVE => Were you involved in any of the burglaries to these celebrities?
REBECCA => No, I wasn't.
DETECTIVE => Is there going to be any property from any of those burglaries in this residence? REBECCA No.
DETECTIVE => Have you been in any of the celebrity's homes that have been burglarized?
REBECCA => No.
DETECTIVE => Could any of your fingerprints of DNA be found in any of the victim's homes?
REBECCA => No.
POLICE OFFICER => We've located a jacket and jeans that match the description by Lohan, and personal photographs of Paris Hilton.
REBECCA => If I tell you where everything is, would you let me go? Hypothetically let's say I may know where this property is located and who has it, how could that help me? DETECTIVE The detectives on this case are trying to recover hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of property for the victims and I'm sure they would say if your cooperation helped them locate it.
REBECCA => I want to help you out, but I don't want to do anything without talking to my attorney.
DETECTIVE => Is this your marijuana?
REBECCA => Yes, I have a prescription for it and bought it in California.
DETECTIVE => You're being arrested for stolen property and L.A.P.D. detectives will be filing charges in their jurisdiction for burglary.
REBECCA => Did you speak to any of the victims?
DETECTIVE => I've spoken to all of the Victims.
REBECCA => Really?! What did Lindsay say? CUT TO:
TV REPORTER => Rebecca Ahn, thought to be the ringleader was arrested, and awaits her hearing with the other members. Stay tuned for the latest on the Bling Ring.
NICKI => Oh my god!
LAURIE => This is crazy.
NICKI => Does this look conservative, is this good?
SAM => If you like a secretary-style hooker.
NICKI => Shut Up.                                                *
NICKI => How about this?
SAM => That's better...you need lower heels.
NICKI => Oh, Yeah, where are my kitten heels...bitch, you're so fucking lucky you weren't on that video...
SAM => I know, that sucks.
LAURIE => Nicki!
LAURIE => Nicki! Kate from Vanity Fair is here.
KATE => What do your parents do?
NICKI => My mom does a lot of things, she's a minister, she's been a masseuse, she's an energy healer...My dad is a director of photography on T.V. shows, he's been in the industry forever....
KATE => And how is Sam related?
NICKI => We've adopted her, we met in ballet class when we were little.
LAURIE => I was friends with her mother--
NICKI => Mom, this is my interview. I met her when my parents divorced. Now she lives with us, my mom's home schooled us all for a while.
LAURIE => The philosophy of `The Secret', it's based on the law of attraction, but my great- grandmother and grandmother both studied this philosophy. It's man's relationship to the Divine, that's what energy science means.
NICKI => Since I was young I learned about every religion. KATE So, Sam was in your ballet class, did she have parents?
NICKI => She had a dysfunctional background, we both did...
LAURIE => And I met her mom--
NICKI => Can I talk please?! The reason we related so well is my dad is a recovering alcoholic and Sam's mom is..
LAURIE => A practicing...
NICKI => A practicing drug addict and alcoholic and our moms became best friends and...
LAURIE => And then she went off the deep end, she was on the verge--
NICKI => Please! I told you that if you're going to be here you had to be quiet! That's why I didn't want you here because you talk!
KATE => So, basically you took her in.
NICKI => Yes, we took her in about 6 years ago.
SHANNON => But let's get back to Nicki.
KATE => So Adam here told me you do charity work.
NICKI => Yes, we do a lot of stuff through our church, it's Agape Church. LAURIE It's the religious science philosophy being taught at Agape Church.
NICKI => My other sister, Gabby is on a trip with them now helping build homes. And they do a yearly trip to Africa where they build wells and schools for kids.
KATE => Which country?
NICKI => Uh, I can't remember exactly which country... We do bake sales and feeding the homeless, that kind of stuff.
KATE => Ok, so it's a little bit of a disconnect with these positive pursuits and what's happening now.
ADAM => Nicki, I don't want you to answer that comment.
NICKI => I think that I'm a firm... I have a good statement to say.
KATE => She can speak generally.
NICKI => I'm not gonna speak about the case, what I was going to say is that I'm a firm believer in karma and I think this situation was attracted into my life as a huge learning lesson for me to grow and expand as a spiritual human being.
NICKI => I don't think the universe chose a better person than me because from this it's not just affecting me, it's affecting the media and everyone and I think I'm meant to bring truth to all this....I believe that I am an old soul.
LAURIE => Yes, she is.
SHANNON => We have gotten to know Nicki and her family and we feel Nicki is an extremely focused, honest person who has a lot to provide to the community. 
KATE => What's your goal or life plan if you have one?
NICKI => I do, I think my journey is to be a leader and push for peace and for the health of our planet--
SHANNON => Nicki has expressed to me a lot of her humanitarianism.
NICKI => It's my main goal. God didn't give me these talents and what I look like to sit around and just be a model or famous. I want to do something people notice, that's why I'm studying business, so I can be a leader and take a stand for people.
MARC => I met Rebecca in school after I moved back and went to Indian Hills, I went there because I had a lot of absences. I didn't want to go to school, I had a lot of self- loathing and anxiety issues, I felt that I was ugly...
KATE => You're not ugly.
MARC => I know I'm not ugly, but I never thought I was an A-list looking guy.I Went to Indian Hills to learn and be with my peers, I felt so self-conscious I didn't look as good as everyone else.
KATE => And now you're a star.
MARC => On my Facebook page recently I had 800 friends requests, I accepted them all, I didn't even look at them, then I noticed someone had created a fan page for me. If it had been for something I had done to help the community or benefit something I'd love it, but it's just kind of awkward for me that these people are loving me for something that's looked down on in society... It's kinda showing that America has some sick fascination with a Bonnie and Clyde kind of thing.
REPORTER => Could these teenagers be at the center of a celebrity crime spree? Police say they have stolen millions in cash, art and jewelry from the mansions of Orlando Bloom, Lindsay Lohan, Paris Hilton and countless other stars.
NICKI => Can I have a 5 mg adderal.
LAURIE => Just remember what we went over with Shannon, they can't prove you were in any of those houses.
NICKI => I know, mom.
NICKI => I know right here and right now there is one mind, one power and one presence.
EMILY => Mom, shouldn't we go?
NICKI => Stop!
EMILY => Stop what?
NICKI => Stop talking.
LAURIE => She's praying.
NICKI => I know I'm always protected and karma cleanses my journey. Thank you Lord, so much for this truth. And so it is.
LAURIE => ... You rock girl!                                    *
NICKI => This is a very difficult time for myself and my family. Thank you for respecting my privacy, I look forward to my day in court. She does a flirtatious eye roll and saunters past the cameras in her kitten heels.
REBECCA'S MOM => Sit up straight, and speak up when you answer questions.
REBECCA => Ok.
REBECCA'S MOM => What were you thinking? While I was working to support you and your sister. I gave you every thing... You've never done anything right.

INTERVIEWER => We're here with Nicki Moore, who just served 30 days for her involvement in the Bling Ring, and shared a cell block with one of the victims- Lindsay Lohan. There were reports that Lindsay was crying, with you being next to her, did you actually hear any of this? NICKI I could hear her crying the first day, which is hard when you're trying to be strong, I just tried to really keep to myself..., I just tried to get through the day , the days are so long you're woken up at 5:30.
INTERVIEWER => And how'd she look?
NICKI => She got to keep her extensions in, most girls were talking about oh- I had to take my weave out...she was in orange like all of us...
INTERVIEWER => Were you nervous you were next to her because you were accused of being a part of that group that allegedly robbed her house.
NICKI => Yeah, it was hard for me there were tabloids and on T.V.s in there people were watching the story and they were showing the surveillance video and stuff... and little do people know that when that video came out I was actually in contact with her manager to tell her who I believed the people were who robbed her house... and eventually when I'm able to tell my story people will know the truth.
INTERVIEWER => So that's nerve wracking she could think you robbed her house.
NICKI => She could've, but you know...yeah...Anyway, you can follow everything about me and my journey at Nickimooreforever dot com.
