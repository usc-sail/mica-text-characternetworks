PUGH => Stranger wanderin around, no job- that would make you a vagrant.
SONNY => But I'm lookin-
PUGH => I got a job for you.   Get in the back.
GATLIN => I can always use another hand.
PUGH => Caught this young fella in flagrant violation of the statutes. Gawkery with intent to mope.
GATLIN => What's he gonna run me?
PUGH => Three dollars a day plus you feed im lunch. Now the sentence- that depends on how long you gonna need the help.
SONNY => I don't get any trial?
SHERIFF PUGH => Sure you do, boy. And a speedy one, too.  Meet Judge Gatlin.
GATLIN => Grab a sack.
MACEO => Saturday night, fellas! Every fine- looking colored woman in the county gonna be there- don't want to miss it!
MACEO => Afternoon, sir.   Nice lookin bunch of soldiers.
AMANDA => Oh dear, I believe it's about that time-
AMANDA => Would you care to join me?
DELILAH => No thank you.
AMANDA => Of course you won't join me, you don't partake. That was thoughtless of me.
DELILAH => That's all right.
AMANDA => So you don't take spirits and- what else? In your church?
DELILAH => I'm sort of between churches right now. I been thinking about changing over to the Holiness, but I- I haven't been sanctified yet.
AMANDA => Ah-
DELILAH => There's been a minister in this week-
AMANDA => The tent out by the fairgrounds.
AMANDA => The church I grew up in- we were Pentacostals- they wouldn't have anything but the human voice inside the church. And dancing- any kind of dancing, music, card playing-- well, it was very strict. They took up serpents.
DELILAH => I've heard of that.
AMANDA => I tell Floyd these stories and he's horrified. They've always been Methodists, Floyd's family.
DELILAH => They're good people too.
AMANDA => When I married Floyd-- oh, it was quite a scandal among my relatives. As if I'd taken up with somebody in a cult.
DELILAH => It can be a trial, married folks differ in their religion.
AMANDA => And your husband is a--- ?
DELILAH => Unaffiliated.
AMANDA => Unaffiliated. I see.    He has his-- social club-
DELILAH => The Honeydripper.
AMANDA => Such a colorful name.
DELILAH => Yes.
AMANDA => He must devote a great deal of his energy to it.
DELILAH => It's just him and Maceo Green runs it, and then I go over and cook some when I get off here.
AMANDA => That's very- supportive of you. Considering the sort of- environment-
DELILAH => I been in those barrooms most of my life, Miss Amanda.
AMANDA => I see-
DELILAH => I was a singer. I met Tyrone in the Paradise, down in Shreveport, China Doll was only two-
DELILAH => I was just kind of livin along, you know, drinking more than I ought-- then Tyrone. It was like a light come into my life.
DELILAH => People think things because he owns the Lounge, but they don't know him.
AMANDA => Small minds are never in short supply.
AMANDA => The people in this town---
AMANDA => I suppose they expected that Floyd, being from a prominent family- as prominent as is possible here in Harmony- would have chosen somebody more--
AMANDA => My people were very devout, but they weren't- financially successful.
DELILAH => No shame in that.
AMANDA => In school, if you didn't have shoes-
AMANDA => Oh, I forgot--
AMANDA => I was going through Emily's old things the other day, and I thought this would look just darling on your China Doll-
DELILAH => Oh- I don't think it would near fit her, Miss Amanda.
AMANDA => How old is she now?
DELILAH => Seventeen.
AMANDA => Oh my- I must have lost track somewhere along the line. Seventeen.
DELILAH => It was a very nice thought.
CHINA DOLL => Mama?   They need you at-
CHINA DOLL => Oh, I'm sorry, Miss Amanda.   I didn't know you was home.
AMANDA => China Doll! We were just recalling-    you used to play right here under this table.
SLICK => There isn't any cash money I know of. She sold a good deal of the furniture, but there's still a nice- lookin sofa in the parlor. Only thing she cared for anymore was singin out to Pinetop's place-
SLICK => You welcome to look around the house- if there's anything your Missus might like-- long as it's not something personal to me and Bertha Mae-
SLICK => It's just- she got to go out in style, is what it is. The best you got, all the trimmins- lay it out for her. That's the way she lived it- that's the way she ought to leave it.
NED => Y'all never done this job before.
SONNY => Can't say I have.
NED => You want to set your pins out wide, bend over from the hip-
NED => -and don't be bobbin up and down all the time. When you up, be up, but when you on the row, stay down.
NED => But most important, you got to get you a rhythm. Everything in this life got a rhythm to it- even pullin cotton off the plant.
SONNY => Lay it out for me.
NED => Not my rhythm- your rhythm. That's between you and the day and the work you got before you. Once you on it, don't let nothin and nobody push you off it.
SONNY => I'm going so slow.
NED => You gettin paid by the pound or by the hour?
SONNY => I'm not gettin paid at all.   None of us are.
NED => Then I suggest you work that into your rhythm too.

JUNEBUG => Take some water.
DEX => Only thing wash the dust out is whiskey.
JUNEBUG => Aint enough whiskey in this world wash out what I swallowed in my life.
JUNEBUG => What we playin for?
DEX => Two bits a hand.
JUNEBUG => That's kind of steep-
DEX => Hell, I member playin this game one night- Memphis is Boss Crump's town, folks is gamblin before they can walk- ten dollars a hand. I caught a winnin streak that cleaned out half the sportin men on Beale Street. Got up from that table, my money was as long as train smoke-
JUNEBUG => What happen to it?
DEX => Spent it all on fine-lookin women.
DEX => Yo, Missippi-
JUNEBUG => His name Hamilton.
DEX => Hambone!   You want in on this?
DEX => Settle up on payday.
HAM => That your deck of cards?
DEX => What if it is?
HAM => I stay clear of it then.
DEX => You sinuatin?
HAM => Just sayin I don't want to play.
JUNEBUG => Looks like dinner.
DEX => Rabbit is a rodent. Man eat a rabbit, might's well eat a rat.
DEX => Simple country nigger, fraid to sit down an lose his little handful of change--
JUNEBUG => He awful big to mess with.
DEX => Don't scare me none. I'm a steppin razor, man, I'm trouble on two legs.
DEX => Your draw, Junebug. And don't be drippin sweat on my cards.
MACEO => Excuse me, folks-
MACEO => Yall heard about the show we puttin on at the Honeydripper Saturday night?
DELILAH => I expect there'll be a nice turnout for Bertha Mae tomorrow.
TY => Folks who wouldn't have nothin to do with her when she was alive.
DELILAH => Some of them, maybe. You still got to pay your respects.
TY => Slick gonna have to find him a new ride.
DELILAH => That's a terrible thing to say-
TY => That's how the man gets over, is all, sugarin up to some woman got a job or a bankroll-
DELILAH => It's no way to live.
TY => Just how it is out in the world, baby- man got to walk through the gates of Hell to get a piece of cheese.
TY => You're not so young any more, lose hold of what little you got-
DELILAH => If you lose the club I'm sure you'll find something else.
TY => In this town?   Like what?
DELILAH => You know anytime you want I could get Miss Amanda to ask her husb-
TY => "Watch yo feet, Mr. Mayor, I done just mopped the flo! "
DELILAH => You work so hard at the Lounge, and what it brings in-
TY => Isn't even as much as what you make polishin that white lady's silver. I know.
DELILAH => I didn't say that.
TY => You didn't have to.
DELILAH => It'll just have to work out, then.
DELILAH => Meetin gonna start without I'm there.
TY => Your soul not the one needs savin, baby.
CHINA DOLL => It's all gonna be fine, Daddy. Everbody in town talkin bout Guitar Sam comin to Harmony.

CHOIR => Oh she cried son, Son don't you worry Oh you know the Lord Always fix a way
CHOIR => She left me standing Standing along the highway Oh wondering- which way I must go!
CHOIR => As I walked- All along the highway I was seeking my Lord each day She left me standing Standing along the highway Just wondering- which way must I go!
REVEREND CUTLIP => The Highway of Life, Brothers and Sisters, will twist you and turn you, it will run you this way and that way, it will tempt you with many a detour-- for the Highway of Life, Brothers and Sisters, is designed to lead us astray!
REVEREND CUTLIP => It meanders away from the Light and into the Darkness, it tires our legs and whittles away at our spirits!
REVEREND CUTLIP => It snares us with the thorns and thistles of wickedness, it is paved with the black deeds of sinners and laid out on a crooked plan! That's not the road we want to be on, Brothers and Sisters, that's not the path we need to follow!
REVEREND CUTLIP => We got to get on that other road! The one that leads to salvation! The one that leads to glory! The one that leads to the right hand of God! Praise His name!
CONGREGATION => Praise the Lord!
REVEREND CUTLIP => The thoroughfare I'm talking about, the righteous path we got to tread, is called the Highway to Heaven, and by the great Lord above it is straight and it is narrow!  REVEREND CUTLIP Keep your eyes on the prize and your feet on the street and you won't ever make a mis-step, you won't ever falter, you won't ever stumble, because Jesus will show you the Way!
REVEREND CUTLIP => But you got to pay attention to who it is walking beside you, Brothers and Sisters, got to be wary against those who will hold you back from your journey! There's many a loved one got to be left behind! Cause you either on the road or you lost in the wilderness!
REVEREND CUTLIP => You either headed for glory or doomed to damnation! You either in with the Lord or you in with the Devil- and they aint no in-between!
KING => Tulsa aint so bad but for the smell-

NED => Must of got caught on one a them freights.
KING => Yeah, aint no free ride allowed through Georgia. And the food there-

KING => Spose you been locked in that box.
NED => Or one just like it.

NED => You a singer, young man?
SONNY => Singer, guitar player- Imonna be on the radio some day. People gonna know my name.
NED => Keep thinkin that way, young man. Judge Gatlin don't choose to work you into your grave, you just might do it.

He sneers, flicks his   cigarette almost straight at us.
48                                                                48 => Possum stops playing and cocks his head to listen-
REVEREND CUTLIP => A mournful end for a wayward sinner.
DELILAH => She always seemed at peace with herself.
REVEREND CUTLIP => The company she kept, the life she led-
DELILAH => I never knew Bertha Mae to do hurt to a living soul.
REVEREND CUTLIP => We're all hoping to see you get over and accept the Lord tonight, Delilah.
DELILAH => I'm hoping so too.
REVEREND CUTLIP => You been lingering at the threshold long enough, Sister. Time to step ahead.
SHACK THOMAS => Tyrone- got somebody gettin off here?

SHACK THOMAS => He's comin here?
SHACK THOMAS => Yo, Nat!    Guitar Sam get on this train?
NAT => Naw, man. He's in the hospital back in Little Rock.

NAT => You know music folks- whatever he was doin, he must have done too much of it.
SHACK THOMAS => Well, brother- maybe he be in tomorrow.
POSSUM => Somebody didn't show up.
TY => Wish they'd made you dumb instead of blind.
TY => Well I had my fun if I Don't get well no more Well I had my fun if I Don't get well no more My head is spinnin And I'm goin down slow-
MACEO => Man don't take care of hisself- out drinkin and jazzin the women every night-
TY => Don't make any difference now.
MACEO => Got so bad, I heard there was some ole boy goes around pretendin to be Guitar Sam, fill out the gigs he misses. Does pretty well for hisself, what I hear-
TY => Somebody we could find?
MACEO => Hell, I don't know.     Just a story I heard.
TY => There must have been a first one.
MACEO => First what?
TY => Back slavery days, they had the ones that worked in the big house. Might not of had shoes always, but their pants didn't have no holes and they didn't pick no cotton.
MACEO => House niggers.
TY => That's how they called em. They must of had all their African kinda instruments- drums, shakers, some kind of banjo thing- but the piano-
MACEO => Didn't bring no piano over on them ships from Africa.
TY => The piano was just sittin there in the white folks' big room, all polished up-- and I figure this one boy, he goes past fifteen, twenty times a day, running the corner of his eye over it. And he's there when they play, the masters, doin all their minuets and whatever-
TY => -him standing there with a tray of white people food pretendin not to have a thought in his head, might be only some dust hangin in the air for all they know- but he's watchin the fingers, see, watchin them keys work. This old boy, the first one, he can play alla them Africa kinda instruments, he can play mud if you give him the key and the tempo, he's got music in his head, in his heart, in every damn piece of him there's music.
MACEO => Down to the bones--
TY => And one day the masters is away, huntin foxes or some rich white people thing they get up to, and he's alone in the room with that piano and he comes over and sits down on the bench-
MACEO => Watch out now-
TY => -and he spreads his fingers out the way he seen the minuet player do- and he-
TY => And he thinks- `Lord help me, I could do some damage with this.'
MACEO => Would have liked to been there. I mean to hear the cat play, not none of the rest of it.
TY => Mace, Imonna lose my club.
MACEO => Old Man Toussaint finds out you stole his liquor, you like to lose more than that-
TY => I got no more cards to play-
MACEO => Maybe if you was to go down, see Lucky Hardaway in person-
TY => I aint kissin up to no cokey-nose, conk-headed-
TY => What the hell that sposed to be?
MACEO => Some kind of guitar.
TY => A guitar has got a hole in it, that's where the sound comes from. That boy must be bout three bricks shy of a load upstairs.
CHINA DOLL => They gone and arrest him!
TY => Arrested who?
CHINA DOLL => Sonny. The high Sheriff arrested him and sold him over to Judge Gatlin.
TY => Who's Sonny?
CHINA DOLL => Sonny that was here yesterday morning.
TY => Sonny that got a screw loose is why they arrested him. Maceo, make a noise on that-
MACEO => It's electric-
TY => I plug a chunk of stove wood into the wall I get more music out of it than that mess gonna make.
MACEO => Naw, man, it don't work unless it's hooked up to the juice, see? You got the juice, you don't need the hollow inside the box, the music just runs straight from the strings through this wire and comes out-
MACEO => -your amplifier. Which is what this thing must be.
CHINA DOLL => Sonny said he fix radios in the Army.
TY => Sonny didn't do nothin but feed bedbugs in anybody's Army, and some of em crawled in his head. Surprised if that boy got the wit to pick cotton. Judge Gatlin bought himself a droolin idiot. What you want to amplify a damn guitar for anyway?
CHINA DOLL => Daddy-
TY => Less you gonna sit over on your chair and play them little Charley Christian kind of riffs-
MACEO => A sideman-
TY => Sit over there and be all clean and polite. Guitar hasn't been up front since them old piss and moan blues shouters, sit their blind asses on the corner hollerin for pennies-
MACEO => Old time music-
CHINA DOLL => Daddy, Sonny didn't do nothin to be arrested for! He was just lookin for work.
MACEO => They hung colored boys for less than that, darlin. Least on the work gang they feed em, keep their strength up.
CHINA DOLL => But he doesn't belong there!
MACEO => You know, Guitar Sam plays him an electric, but I don't think it's this no-hole kind of deal.
TY => I hope he plugs it in the wrong socket some night, lectrocutes his sorry no-show ass!
TY => Now if he did show up here-- and our power was to go out again while he was playing-
MACEO => I think I fixed it good this time, Ty.
TY => So he come out and plugs his ax in-
MACEO => He come out lookin good, from what I hear. All kind of spangly pants and jacket, got his name spelled out on the back-
TY => Clothes, right-
MACEO => Hair all slick and shiny, flash some gold teeth at them gals, got his sax man behind him, maybe a piano, harmonica, drums-
TY => You remember that night the lights went out in the Esquire Club in Mobile?
MACEO => And somebody took off with the gate? Stole the whole damn register off the counter-
TY => They didn't hold it against Reggie Porter, did they?
MACEO => Naw- it was his place that got robbed.
TY => Didn't hold it against him, didn't expect no money back for the show-
MACEO => They all too busy diving on the pot of that tonk game got interrupted-
TY => And nobody suspected it might be Reggie Porter hisself that pulled them lights, did they?
MACEO => Aw, no, Ty, we can't-
TY => China Doll, you mind the place while we're gone!  Come on, man, we got work to do.
CHINA DOLL => Where you going, Daddy?
TY => I promise the people Guitar Sam, they gonna get Guitar Sam!
SHERIFF PUGH => Why you interested in this boy?
TY => Got a job for him.
SHERIFF PUGH => Must be doin pretty good for yourself out there, Tyrone, you hirin new people on.
TY => Passing well, yeah-
SHERIFF PUGH => But this boy-
TY => Name is Sonny-
SHERIFF PUGH => He's payin off his debt to society right now, and if I was to pull him out of the field it would cost the county-
TY => Judge Gatlin payin three a day for prison labor.
SHERIFF PUGH => You gonna pay me four for the duration of his sentence?
TY => Which might be- ?
SHERIFF PUGH => -as long as I care to make it.
TY => Well, I was counting on more of a one-time deal- if I could just rent him out for the weekend-
SHERIFF PUGH => Fifty dollars.
SHERIFF PUGH => It's not just the money. There's legalistic principles involved here. Public safety issues-
TY => I pay you Sunday morning?
SHERIFF PUGH => You pay me now or you forget about it.
TY => I don't have it now.
SHERIFF PUGH => You think you too smart for the rest of us, don't you, Tyrone? Think you can go it by yourself.
SHERIFF PUGH => You'd rather eat roofin nails than come to me for a favor-
TY => It's not a favor if I got to pay-
SHERIFF PUGH => Oh, you gonna pay all right. You don't hand me that money Sunday mornin, you got yourself a new partner. Same deal as I got with Toussaint. How'd that be?
TY => You'll get the fifty.
SHERIFF PUGH => And that wife of yours-
TY => Delilah-
SHERIFF PUGH => Them fried chicken sandwiches- if I was to come by, now and then, check up on my interests-
TY => She be happy to fix you whatever you want.
SHERIFF PUGH => My wife's cookin would gag a maggot.
TY => Different people got different kinds of talents.
SHERIFF PUGH => Lurleen aint discovered what hers is yet. Let's go fetch that boy.
DEPUTY => This the one?
TY => You got any ideas about turning rabbit on me, you best get rid of em now.
SONNY => You payin my way out?

MACEO => Yeah, I spose you do-
NADINE => You gone make me happy, baby?
MACEO => Uhm- you come by the club tonight, we havin a special show. Tell em at the door you my guest-
NADINE => Food aint the only thing a woman needs three times a day.
MACEO => Wouldn't hurt you to skip a few meals.
NADINE => What's that, baby?
MACEO => Boy's gonna need time to try that jacket on- see how it feels. Later, Nadine-
TY => You got to do somethin with this boy's head, darlin. They might not know what the real Sam look like, but it aint this.
CHINA DOLL => I can try.
SONNY => And what exactly I'm supposed to do?
TY => You gone stand up there with that contraption you got an play Guitar Sam numbers.
SONNY => Hell, I do that with my eyes closed.
TY => We could get the audience to close theirs we be better off.

CHINA DOLL => I fix Mama's hair all the time.
SONNY => But you aint been to that school yet.
CHINA DOLL => You go to school to learn your guitar?
SONNY => No.
CHINA DOLL => I might pick up some new things at beauty school but mostly it's for my certificate, and that is `a ticket to adventure'- that's what it says in the brochure. People lookin for beauty all over the world.
SONNY => You want to watch out for them wires sticking down- don't look safe.
CHINA DOLL => Yeah- power's always going out, people getting shocks and whatnot-
SONNY => Somebody ought to fix it.
CHINA DOLL => `A career in beauty is like money in the bank.' Says that in the brochure too. Plus it isn't physically taxin.
SONNY => Yeah, I can't see no pretty thing like you behind a plow.
CHINA DOLL => I had the rheumatic fever when I was little, left me with a weak heart.
SONNY => Oh. Mine been actin funny too- since I laid eyes on you.
SONNY => What's that?
CHINA DOLL => Just some ole moonshine they keep around.
SONNY => What you gonna do with it?
CHINA DOLL => They always joke about how this stuff'll straighten your hair right out-
CHINA DOLL => Imonna just make yours relax a little.
MACEO => Mr. Time Trenier- that's a name to be reckoned with.
MACEO => Story goes that you used to play with Buddy Bolden.
TIME => Played with most all of em down there.
MACEO => And King Oliver-

DEX => Wouldn't let nobody mess with my money like that.
HAM => They took the same two dollars off yours.
DEX => Yeah, and you could pave a highway with the rocks I threw in that mess.

SHERIFF PUGH => Don't let me stop you.
SHERIFF PUGH => But first you gonna sign that ledger like you sposed to. Don't want nobody cryin they didn't get their due.
SONNY => Mr. Purvis?
TY => People call me Ty or they call me Pinetop. Mr. Pinetop to you.
SONNY => I just wanted to tell you- I preciate the opportunity.
TY => Right.
SONNY => I know ever one of Guitar Sam's songs- know the chords, know the words-
TY => That's fine.
SONNY => China Doll said how you was famous once.
TY => I was known, but I was never what you call famous.
SONNY => How'd you get your start?
TY => Down in Mobile there was an old cathouse professor name of Joe Dudlow, had had a stroke on one side, curled him all up- but he kept on pluggin. I used to come out and play his left hand for him.
SONNY => How old you were?
TY => Thirteen, fourteen. This one night it was goin hot and heavy and Joe just passed, right there at the piano, in the middle of Black Bottom Stomp. They propped him up at the bar, stuck a drink in his hand, and told me to keep poundin them ivories. There was a meanness hanging over them juke joints, there was murder in the air. You stopped playin for a minute, it come down like a flock of crows.
SONNY => This is you-
TY => Big band days, on the road. If a railroad train run through it, we played it.
SONNY => `Reginald Erskine'. Don't believe I ever heard of him-
TY => Big tall light-skin fella out of Carolina, said he's part Cherokee. Couldn't play nothin, but he waved his little stick and had this long greasy hair he throw around like Cab Calloway.
SONNY => And you were the piano man.
TY => Piano man, arranger, you name it.
SONNY => That must of been somethin, see the country first class.
TY => I don't know about first class, but we seen the country.
SONNY => How come you stopped?
TY => Got tired of carrying another man's water. Didn't want to die in no colored hotel some night in Who-Knows-Where Arkansas.
TY => Met Delilah and wanted something of my own.
SONNY => Well you don't have nothing to worry about, Mr. Pinetop. I won't let you down tonight.
TY => No-   I don't spose you will.
DELILAH => How could you do that?
TY => Imonna put that back and double-
