SILAS => Three weeks and we're still no closer to cracking this?
SILAS => Right... bring him in.
LUCY => Yes, sir.
AGNES => This is the best party EVER!!!
EDITH => Haha!   Yeah! DESPICABLE ME 2           CINCO & KEN DRAFT       3.
AGNES => Oh no!   A dragon is approaching!
MARGO => Fear not, for here come the gallant knights to save us!
GRU => No, no, no! What do you mean she's not coming?! I have a backyard full of these little girls who are counting on a visit from a fairy princess!
GRU => Ah!   Hurts! Ah! Stop it!
GRU => Listen! I don't want a refund! I want a fairy princess... please! Please, I am begging you.  You know what? I hope that you can sleep at night, you crusher of little girls' dreams!!!
AGNES => Ooh ooh!   When's the Fairy Princess coming?
GRU => Any minute now!
AGNES => Yayyy!
GRU => Stall them.
MARGO => Whoa! Whoa! Okay, okay, alright. That's enough of the magic show!
MINIONS => Awwww. DESPICABLE ME 2            CINCO & KEN DRAFT   5.
MARGO => Wait, did you hear that? It sounded like the twinkling sounds of magical fairy dust.
AGNES =>  It's the fairy princess!   She's coming!
MARGO => Look!
GRU => Aaaaaahh!
GRU =>  It is I, Gru...zinkerbell! The most magical fairy princess of all! And I am here to wish Princess Agnes a very happy birthday!
LITTLE GIRL => How come you're tho fat?
GRU => Because my house is made of candy and sometimes I eat instead of facing my problems.
LITTLE GIRL => How come you have-
GRU => Okay!   Time for cake!
AGNES => Thank you, Gru-zinkerbell. You're the best fairy princess ever!
GRU =>  You are welcome, little girl.
AGNES =>  I know it's really you, Gru. I'm just pretending for the other kids.
JILLIAN => Hey there, Gru, Mr. Life of the Party!
GRU =>  Hello, Jillian.
JILLIAN => Sooooo, I'm gonna go out on a limb here, but my friend Natalie is recently single, and... DESPICABLE ME 2             CINCO & KEN DRAFT   7.
GRU =>  No, no, no, get off of the limb right now. No limb.
JILLIAN => Oh, come on...she's a riot. She sings karaoke, she has a lot of free time, looks aren't that important to her...
GRU => No, Jill's, that is not happening. Seriously. I'm fine.
JILLIAN =>  Okay, fine. Forget Natalie.        How about my cousin Linda?
GRU => No.
JILLIAN => Oh, oh! I know someone whose husband just died!
GRU => I'm sorry.     I did not see you there.
GRU => Or there.
GRU => Kyle... Kyle!
GRU => Ky--Kyle!   No, do not do your business on the petunias!
GRU => There you go. Those are Fred's. Go crazy.
GRU => Good boy.
VOICE => Mr. Gru?
GRU => Wha?   I didn't... What... Yes?
LUCY =>  Hi! Agent Lucy Wilde of the AVL. (realizes her badge is upside down) Oh. Whoops. (clears her throat, all business) Sorry, you're gonna have to come with me.
GRU => Oh, sorry, I--Freeze Ray! DESPICABLE ME 2                 CINCO & KEN DRAFT      9.
LUCY => You know you really should announce your weapons after you fire them, Mr. Gru. For example--
LUCY => Lipstick Taser! Oh, it works so good.
LUCY => Man.    Ugh.     Large...person.
LUCY => Oh...sorry!
LUCY => Get...in...there...you...big...man!
TOM => Koom ey lah!
STUART => Koom ey lah! Koom ey lah!
STUART => Aaaaaaiiieeeaaaiiieeeaaaah!
STUART => Woooo!
TOM => Ooooh!
STUART => Quack quack!
CONFUSED FISHERMAN => What the--     Oh!
MINIONS => Whoa...
GRU =>  Ugh...ooh...what...where...ah...oh, foot's asleep...ah...pins and needles...
SILAS => Good afternoon, Mr. Gru.
GRU => Ehhh...
SILAS => I apologize for our methods in getting you here.
LUCY => I don't. I'd do it again in a heartbeat. I am not gonna lie--I enjoyed that. Every second of it. Gave me a bit of a buzz, actually.
SILAS => That's enough, Agent Wilde.
LUCY => Sorry, sir.
GRU => Okay, this is bogus!
GRU => I don't know who you people think you are, but--
SILAS => We are the Anti-Villain League. DESPICABLE ME 2             CINCO & KEN DRAFT   13.
SILAS => An ultra-secret organization dedicated to fighting crime on a global scale. Rob a bank? We're not interested. Kill someone? Not our deal. But you want to melt the polar ice caps? Or vaporize Mt. Fuji? Or even steal the moon? Then we notice.
GRU => First of all, you've got no proof that I did that. Second, after I did do that, I put it back!
SILAS => We're well aware of that, Mr. Gru. That's why we've brought you here.  I am the League's director, Silas Ramsbottom.
TOM => Bottom.
SILAS => Hilarious.     Agent Wilde...
LUCY => Oh, me now...?
LUCY => Um, recently an entire top secret lab disappeared from the Arctic Circle. Yeah, the entire lab. Just whoosh. Voom! Gone. Where did it go? DESPICABLE ME 2              CINCO & KEN DRAFT    14.
GRU => I don't care.
LUCY => The lab was devoted to experiments involving PX-41, a transmutation serum. What is PX-41, you ask? Mmmm, it's pretty bad... Look.
GRU => Oh!
GRU => Hmm, you usually don't see that in bunnies.
SILAS => As you can see, in the wrong hands, the PX-41 serum could be the most devastating weapon on earth. (struggles to get through the opening in the table) Fortunately it has a very distinct chemical footprint, and using the latest chemtracking technology, we found traces of it in the Paradise Mall.
GRU => Ha!   A mall? DESPICABLE ME 2             CINCO & KEN DRAFT   15.
SILAS => Precisely. And we believe that one of these shop owners is a master criminal.
SILAS => And that's where you come in. As an ex-villain, you know how a villain thinks, how a villain acts.
LUCY => The plan is to set you up undercover at a shop in the mall, where hopefully you'll be able to--
GRU => Okay, I see where this is going, with all the Mission Impossible stuff, but no. No! I am a father now. And a legitimate businessman. I am developing a line of delicious jams and jellies.
SILAS => Jams and...jellies?
GRU => Oh, attitude! That's right! So thanks, but no thanks.  And here's a tip--instead of tasing people and kidnapping them, maybe you should just give them a call! Good day, Mr. Sheepsbutt!
SILAS => Ramsbottom.
GRU =>  Oh, yeah, like that's any better!
SUBMARINE. => DESPICABLE ME 2            CINCO & KEN DRAFT       16.
LUCY => Look, I probably shouldn't be saying this, but your work as a villain was kind of amazing, so if you ever want to get back to doing something awesome--give us a call.
TOM =>  Mack-oh! Mack-oh!    Mack-oh!
GRU =>  Hey, I told you guys to get to bed.
MARGO => Oh, sorry.
EDITH => So when ya goin' on your date?
GRU => What?
EDITH => Remember? Miss Jillian said she was arranging a date for you.
GRU => Yeah, well, she is a nutjob.    And I'm not going on any date. DESPICABLE ME 2              CINCO & KEN DRAFT    17.
EDITH => Why not?    Are you scared?
LISA =>  Hey, did you guys see the moon landing on TV?
GIRLS => Yeah, I can't believe it.     It's so cool...
LISA => Yeah, and you know what--
LITTLE GRU => Excuse me, Lisa?
LISA =>  I was talking to Billy the other day.
GIRLS => No way.
LISA => He is so cute.
LISA => And I think he likes me.
GRU => Hey Lisa, I was wondering if you--
Lisa's shoulder. => DESPICABLE ME 2                 CINCO & KEN DRAFT   18.
GIRL => Ewww! Gru touched Lisa!         Gru touched Lisa!
GIRLS => Eeeeewww!
GRU => Scared? Of what? Women?! No, that's bonkers! I just-- I have no interest in going on a date, that's all. Case closed. I'm not scared-- of women... or dates... let's go to bed.
GRU => Goodnight, Edith.
GRU => Goodnight, Margo.
GRU => Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Well, hold the horses. Who are you texting?
MARGO => No one.   Just my friend Avery. DESPICABLE ME 2            CINCO & KEN DRAFT   19.
GRU => Avery... Avery? Is that a girl's name or a boy's name?
MARGO => Does it matter?
GRU => No, no, it doesn't matter... Unless it's a boy!
AGNES => I know what makes you a boy.
GRU => Uh...oooh...you...do?
AGNES => Your bald head.
GRU => Oh, yes...
AGNES => It's really smooth. Sometimes I stare at it and imagine a little chick popping out. Peep peep peep.
GRU => Goodnight, Agnes.   Never get older.
SUPERVISOR MINION => Hey, oh!    Me banana! DESPICABLE ME 2             CINCO & KEN DRAFT   20.
GRU => Hey, Tim, nice haircut!
GRU => Donnie, hang in there, baby!    It's almost Friday.
GRU => So, how's today's batch, Dr. Nefario?
DR.    NEFARIO => I developed a    new formula which allowed me to    get every known kind of berry into    one flavor of jelly.
GRU =>  That tastes good...  Love the flavor of that...
DR. NEFARIO => It's horrible, isn't it? DESPICABLE ME 2           CINCO & KEN DRAFT    21.
GRU => No! No! Oh, we're making great progress!  Here, try some of this.
GRU => Whoa... okay, just because everybody hates it doesn't mean it's not good.
DR. NEFARIO => Listen, Gru. There's something I've been meaning to talk to you about for some time now.
GRU => What?   What's wrong?
DR. NEFARIO =>  I miss being evil. Sinister plots, large-scale crimes...It's what I live for! I mean, don't you think there's more to our future than jelly?
GRU => Well, I'm also considering a line of jams...
DR. NEFARIO => Um...the thing is, Gru...  I've had an offer of employment elsewhere.
GRU => Dr. Nefario! Come on, you're kidding, right?
DR. NEFARIO => It's a great opportunity for me, bigger lab, more evil, full dental...
GRU => Very well. Let us give you the proper send-off.  Minions!
GRU => The highest honor awarded. To Dr. Nefario for your years of service. The twenty-one fart gun salute!
DR. NEFARIO => Uh, I counted twenty-two.
DR. NEFARIO => Farewell, my friends.
DR. NEFARIO => This may take a while. Go about your business.
DR. NEFARIO => I miss you already!

AGNES => Are you sure we should be doing this?
MARGO => Yes, it's for his own good.
MARGO => Okay, we need to choose a picture.
AGNES => No.
AGNES => Scary.
CLICK. => DESPICABLE ME 2           CINCO & KEN DRAFT    24.
EDITH => Weird.
GIRLS => Aaaaaah!!!
AGNES => What is that?!
GRU => Good morning, girls! I have an announcement to make.
MARGO => Hey, what celebrity do you look like?
GRU => Ummm...Bruce Willis.
MARGO => Mmmm...no.
AGNES => Humpty Dumpty!
EDITH => Ooh, Gollum!
GRU => Okay, what are you doing?
AGNES => We're signing you up for online dating!
GRU => Oh, okay...WHAT?! No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
EDITH => Aw come on, it's fun.
MARGO => And it's time for you to get out there.
GRU => No! Stop!      No one is ever getting out there!     Ever!
GRU => Okay, now for the announcement:    I have accepted a new job.
MARGO => Whoa--really?
GRU => Yes, I have been recruited by a top secret agency to go undercover and save the world!
EDITH => You're gonna be a spy?!
GRU => That's right, baby! Gru's back in the game! With gadgets and weapons and cool cars...the whole deal.
EDITH => Awesome!
AGNES => Are you really gonna save the world?
GRU => Yes.   Yes I am.
DAVE => Mocha! DESPICABLE ME 2              CINCO & KEN DRAFT   26.
KEVIN => Cacao!
STUART => Papadam?
GRU => Hm.     "Bake My Day."   Blech.
GRU => Alright, here is the cupcake recipe I got off the internet.
GRU => And don't go nuts with the sprinkles!

LUCY => Ha! Yaa!      Ho! Ooof!   Zaaa!   Ay-ay- ay-ay-ay!
LUCY => Whoo. Wasn't expecting that. (strikes a martial arts pose) Or was I?
LUCY => Ooh... you got... You got... a little...
LUCY => Here, I'll-- I'll get it.
LUCY => Oh, that's just spreading...um...
GRU => Alright, alright.    I got it.    I got it!... Stop it!
LUCY => Oh!     I'll let you get it.
LUCY => Yeah, what you just saw there was a little something new I've been working on. It's a combination of Jujitsu, Krav Maga, Aztec warfare, and krumping.
GRU => Okay, that's weird--why are you here?
LUCY => On assignment from Silas.   I'm your new partner. Yay!
GRU => What?! No, no "yay." Ramsbottom didn't say anything about a partner.
LUCY => Well, seems that because of your checkered past, everyone else refused to work with you. But not me. I stepped up. And I'm new, so I kind of have to do what they tell me anyway.
DAVE => Walla!
LUCY => You know this guy?
GRU => Yes, he's one of my minions.
LUCY => Oh, I'm sorry. I should have known.
LUCY => You're free to go. DESPICABLE ME 2             CINCO & KEN DRAFT     29.
GRU => Dave...
GRU => Earth to Dave!     You can leave now.
GRU => Now, what do we got? Who's on the list? Fire `em at me.
LUCY => First suspect...Hedda Blumentoft, proprietor of Mum's the Word Floral Shop.
GRU => No.    Not her.
LUCY => Okay, moving on...
LUCY => Chuck Kinney, owner of "Stuff-A- Bear."
LUCY => Ooh.
GRU => I don't think so.
EDUARDO => Hello?
GRU => Oh!
EDUARDO => Buenos dias, my friends! I am Eduardo Perez, owner of Salsa & Salsa Restaurant, across the mall. Now open for breakfast. And you are? DESPICABLE ME 2            CINCO & KEN DRAFT   31.
GRU => Gru. And this is Lucy.    And we are closed.
EDUARDO => This is just gonna take un momento. I am throwing a big Cinco de Mayo party, and I am going to need two hundred of your best cupcakes decorated with the Mexican flag. It looks something like this.
EDUARDO => What do you think?
GRU => Look away!
LUCY => You-- Whoa... Hooo...
EDUARDO => Anyway, I have to go. It's all settled! I pick `em up next week! Have a good day. Come by if you get a chance, okay?
EDUARDO => And welcome to the mall family!
GRU =>  El Macho.
LUCY => What?
GRU => But it couldn't be... DESPICABLE ME 2           CINCO & KEN DRAFT      32.
LUCY => Wha-- What? What couldn't be??
GRU => That guy looks exactly like a villain named El Macho. From about twenty years ago.
GRU => He was ruthless. He was dangerous. And as the name implies, very macho.
GRU => He had a reputation for pulling off heists using only his bare hands.
GRU => Ah, but sadly, like all the greats, El Macho was gone too soon. DESPICABLE ME 2           CINCO & KEN DRAFT    33.
GRU => He died in the most macho way possible.
GRU => Riding a shark with 250 pounds of dynamite strapped to his chest into the mouth of an active volcano.
GRU => It was glorious.
LUCY => Yeah, sounds like El Macho's pretty dead...
GRU => They never found the body. Oh no. All that was ever retrieved was a pile of singed chest hair.  But... that face. It has got to be El Macho.
LUCY => Then what do you say you and I break into his restaurant? Tonight.
GRU => Yes, that's good, because I'm telling you--if anybody in this place has the PX-41 serum...
GRU => ...it's him.
GRU => Alright, alright, homework done, pajamas on, teeth brushed, time for bed.
MARGO => What's the big hurry?
GRU => I just... I have a lot of work to do.
EDITH => Work, what kind of work?
GRU => Very important business. So...hugs, kisses...  ...good night, sleep tight, don't let the bedbugs blah-blah-blah-blah- blah--
AGNES => But you said you'd help me practice my part for the Mother's Day show!
GRU => Fine, fine... Let me hear it. Quickly. DESPICABLE ME 2             CINCO & KEN DRAFT   35.
AGNES =>  She kisses my boo-boos She braids my hair My mother is beyond compare We love you, mothers, everywhere!
GRU => Wow! That was...something else. I really liked the way you smiled at the end. Let's try this one more time, but a teensy bit less like a zombie, okay?
AGNES => Okay.  She kisses my boo-boos She braids my hair--
GRU => Perfect!   Time to go!
AGNES => I don't think I should do this.
GRU => Well, what do you mean?    Why not?
AGNES => I don't even have a mom.
GRU => Well, you don't need one to do the show. I mean, you did the Veterans Day Pageant and you haven't been in combat.
AGNES => This is different. DESPICABLE ME 2             CINCO & KEN DRAFT     36.
GRU => Okay, well, then...maybe you can just use your imagination.
AGNES => You mean I pretend I have a mom?
GRU => Yes, right. You can do that, can't you?
AGNES => Yeah! I do that all the time! Thanks, Gru!
MINIONS => Hey!
GRU => Alright, hey, hey--   No, no, no, no! Hey, please!

LUCY => Right.   Gotcha.
GRU => Alright, El Macho, you're going down.
LUCY => Wait!    Wait!
GRU => What?
GRU => What are you doing?
LUCY => I'm checking for laser beam alarm triggers.
GRU => It's a restaurant!
LUCY => You never know what kind of booby traps this guy could have set. Huh? C'mon!
GRU => There are no booby traps!
LUCY => Ha!   Booby!
LUCY => Oh. There's a chicken. Are you lost little guy? You must be lost!

GRU =>  Bah...

GRU => Oh, that's an image I'll never get out of my brain. Blagh!
GRU => I knew it!
GRU => The serum is in here!
LUCY => Ooh, then let's get it!

GRU => Well, we really should be going. Girls, come on.
EDUARDO => That is a pity. Young love is beautiful, no?
GRU => No!  You know, they're not in love. They hardly know each other!
EDUARDO => You are right, Cabeza de Huevo! They must get to know each other better. Antonio, why don't you invite your girlfriend and her family to our Cinco de Mayo party?
GRU => No, no, I am--
GIRLS => Si!
SILAS => I'm sorry, El Macho? Hadn't we eliminated him as a suspect? After the whole salsa incident?
GRU => Yes, but there has been a new development, and I'm telling you, this is the guy. You need to arrest him immediately. And his deviously charming son. I'm pretty sure that the son is involved, too. The son also. You've got to get the son.
GRU =>  I think that the son is the mastermind. There's a look. There's a devilish look in his eyes and I don't like it!
SILAS => Yes, but I don't really see any evidence for--
GRU => Evidence schmevidence! I go with my gut, and my gut tells me that this guy is El Macho! Lock him up! Lock up the son. Don't forget about the son. The kid gives me the creeps!
SILAS => Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear...
LUCY => Uh, but, on the less...  ..."crazy" side of things, uh, Gru discovered traces of the serum at Eagle Hair Club. DESPICABLE ME 2            CINCO & KEN DRAFT   59.
SILAS => Hm...    Interesting...
LUCY => Yeah, and you know who made that happen? Huh?  This guy. Nailed it. Amazing, right?
GRU => No. I mean, sure, but it's not him. It is...  ...El Macho.
SILAS => Mr. Gru.     Please--
GRU => No.   It is him!   And I will prove it!
LUCY =>  Gru, c'mon!
LUCY =>  He really thinks it's El Macho. Can you tell?
POPSICLE MINION => Koonga!
GRU => Kevin, the wi-fi's out!     Kevin?
GRU => Hey, Lance! Where the heck is Kevin?
GRU => Alright, we need to revisit the number of vacation days you guys get. I can't find anybody anymore!
JILLIAN => Gru!   It's Jillian!
JILLIAN => I've got good news! DESPICABLE ME 2             CINCO & KEN DRAFT   61.
JILLIAN => I have my friend Shannon here with me! I was thinking you two could get some grub, you know, tear it up! See what happens!
JILLIAN => Uhh, open up!
GRU => Agnes! Agnes!     Tell Jillian I'm not here!
AGNES => Gru's not here!
JILLIAN => Are you sure?
AGNES => Yes!   He just told me!
AGNES => I mean no, he didn't just tell me!
JILLIAN =>  Agnes--where is Gru?
AGNES => He's putting on lipstick!
AGNES => He's swatting at flies! DESPICABLE ME 2             CINCO & KEN DRAFT     62.
AGNES => He's...chopping his head off!
AGNES => He's...pooping?
JILLIAN => I know you're in there, Gru! There's no way you're getting out of this!
SHANNON => I have to tell you, I was so nervous about tonight. I mean there's just so many phonies out there!
GRU => Yes, I hear you. 
SHANNON => Oh, so do you work out?
GRU => Well...
SHANNON => I mean, obviously, you don't, but would you consider it? Huh?  DESPICABLE ME 2              CINCO & KEN DRAFT    63.
SHANNON => Physical fitness is very important to Shannon. As you can tell, right? Huh?
GRU => Ah.   I can tell.
SHANNON =>  Solid.
GRU => We are in a restaurant, you know.
LUCY => Hi.   Takeout for Lucy?
HOSTESS => Sure, just a sec.
SHANNON => Your accent is so exotic.
GRU => Ah. Well, thank you very much.      I was--
SHANNON => I know someone who can fix that for you. And you'll be talking normal in no time.
GRU => Hahaha. Hoooo. Is it hot in here? Oof. How's the food? DESPICABLE ME 2             CINCO & KEN DRAFT     64.
SHANNON => Wait a minute. Wait a minute.      Are you wearing a wig?
GRU =>  What? Ah!  I don't think so.
SHANNON => I knew it.     You're a phony.   I hate phonies.
GRU => Oh. What? No.      These locks are all mine...
SHANNON => No they're not! You know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna rip that thing off your head and show everyone what a bald-headed phony you are.
LUCY => I don't think so, Miss Lady.
GRU => Hello... Hello, are you...?
LUCY => Hey, Gru.
GRU => Hello, Lucy, how you doin'...? DESPICABLE ME 2             CINCO & KEN DRAFT   65.
LUCY =>  Wow, looks like your date's out for the count. It's like she's been shot with a mild moose tranquilizer.
LUCY =>  Yeah, I'm winking `cuz that's what actually happened.
ITALIAN WAITER =>  `Scusi, whassa happenin' here?    She no like?
LUCY => Oh, she's just uh-- 
ITALIAN WAITER =>  Oh, oh, si, si...
LUCY => Shall we take her home?
LUCY => Well, I think you did it. You just officially had the worst date ever.
GRU => Huh, tell me about it.
LUCY => Don't worry--it can only get better from here, right? But if it doesn't, you can always borrow my dart gun. I've had to use it on one or two dates myself.
GRU => Yeah, you know, as far as dates go, I think I'm good with just the one.
LUCY => Well, good night, partner.
LUCY => This was fun.
GRU => Yes.   Surprisingly, it was.
LUCY => Oh, and uh, just between you and me? You look much better bald. DESPICABLE ME 2                CINCO & KEN DRAFT    67.

GRU =>  Mr. Ramsbottom?
SILAS => Oh, hello. DESPICABLE ME 2             CINCO & KEN DRAFT    69.
GRU => What are you doing here?
SILAS => We got him.
GRU => Got who?
SILAS => Floyd Eaglesan! Our agents located a secret room in his shop last night, and uh, discovered this!
SILAS => It's empty, but we found traces of the PX-41 serum in it. He's our man. So somehow, in spite of your incompetence, we solved this one.
FLOYD => I was framed! You won't get away with this! Get your mitts off of me! I am a legitimate businessman!
GRU => Ah.   Alright. So...what now?
SILAS => Well, now you're free to go back to your "business." Mmmm. Jams and jellies. And it looks like Agent Wilde will be transferring to our Australian branch.
GRU =>  Australia...?
SILAS => Yes. But thank you--for everything. And by everything of course I mean...nothing.  Toodle pip and cheerio, Mr. Gru. DESPICABLE ME 2            CINCO & KEN DRAFT    70.
LUCY => Hey there.
GRU => Hey.
LUCY => So...we got him.
GRU => Yay.  That's great.  And now you're going to Australia?
LUCY => Well, it's not definite yet. Still figuring it out. Already been working on my accent.  Wallaby. Diggeri-doo. Hugh Jackman.  So...um. Pretty excited...
GRU => Great.   Well...good luck.
LUCY => Thanks. You too.  Oh. Here. I wanted to give you this.
GRU => Your lipstick taser?
LUCY => Yeah, it's just a memento. Just, you know, from the first time we met.
GRU => Oh.    Thank you, Lucy.
SILAS => Agent Wilde! DESPICABLE ME 2             CINCO & KEN DRAFT      71.
GRU => Well... it looks like they need you, so...
LUCY => Yeah, I uh, I better go.    Bye, Gru.
AGNES => I brought you an umbrella.
GRU => Ah, thank you.
AGNES => What're you doing out here?
GRU => Remember when you said that I liked Lucy? Well, it turns out...you're right.
AGNES => Really?
GRU => Yes, but...well, she's moving away.  I'm never going to see her again.
AGNES => Is there anything I can do to help?
GRU => Oh, I don't--I don't think so, sweetheart.
AGNES => Well, is there anything you could do?
GRU => "Hello, Lucy. This is Gru. I know up to this point our relationship has been strictly professional, and you're leaving for Australia and all, but..."  Okay, here is the question. "Would you like to--to go out on a date?"
DAVE => Eh, no.
GRU => Okay, that's not helping.
GRU => All right.     Here we go.   For real this time. DESPICABLE ME 2              CINCO & KEN DRAFT      73.

GRU => Agnes, easy on the churros.
GRU => Edith, try not to kill anyone.
EDITH => Hai!
GRU => Margo--
ANTONIO => Hello, Mr. Gru.
GRU => Aghhh!    Okay...
MARGO => Gru!
GRU => There must be the standard six feet of space between you and boys.  Especially this boy.
ANTONIO =>  You are a funny man. There are no rules, Seor! It's Cinco De Mayo!  Come on! They're starting the dance!
AGNES =>  Arrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrriba!
EDUARDO => So glad you could make it, mi compadre.
EDUARDO =>  Hey, what's wrong?
GRU => Oh, nothing. Nothing is wrong. I'm just chilling with the guac...from my chip hat.
EDUARDO => Gru, please. I know that look all too well. It is the look of a broken heart.
GRU => How did you know?
EDUARDO => Believe me, my friend, I too have spent many nights trying to drown my sorrows in guacamole.
GRU => You?
EL MACHO => Yes. But we are survivors. There's much more to us than meets the eye. Enjoy the party.
GRU => What the--oh!

LUCY => I choose Gru.  I CHOOSE GRU!
LUCY => Thank you, Gru stewardess!
FLIGHT ATTENDANT => You're welcome!
EDUARDO => You have not lost your touch, my friend.
GRU => Ha ha!    I knew it!   You are El Macho!
EL MACHO => That's right!
GRU => Nobody believed me! Ho ho!     But I knew you weren't dead! DESPICABLE ME 2           CINCO & KEN DRAFT    82.
EL MACHO =>  Of course not. I merely faked my death, ha, ha!  But now it's time for me to make a spectacular return to evil! Doctor, I think it's time we showed Gru what we're up to here.
GRU => Dr. Nefario?
DR. NEFARIO => Nice to see you, Gru.
GRU => Whaaat? This-- So, this is your new job opportunity?
DR. NEFARIO => Absolutely. You're gonna like this.
EL MACHO => Sorry--I had to borrow some of your minions, but it was for a worthy cause.
GRU => Oh!   Kevin? Agh!
EL MACHO => No, he's not Kevin anymore. Now he is an indestructible, mindless killing machine!
KEVIN => Blah!
EL MACHO => Just watch this!
EL MACHO => And here's the best part! I've got an ARMY OF THEM!
EL MACHO => Soon I will unleash them on the world--and if anyone, anyone, tries to stop them...YEOW! Their city gets eaten!  We can do it together!
GRU => Together?
EL MACHO => Together! I have admired your work for years, amigo. Stealing the moon?! Are you kidding?! We would be unstoppable! Men like you, men like me, we should be ruling the world!  So, are you in?
DR. NEFARIO => Woo-hoo!
GRU => Uh...yeah...probably...
EL MACHO => Probably?
GRU => I mean, yes! Yes. Of course, yes, I just have a lot going on right now...I just need to get some things off my plate before we start taking over the world, that's all.
EL MACHO => `Scuse me?
GRU => No--no, forget it! One hundred percent! I am in! (pretending to hear something) I think--what is--do you hear that-- I do. That's Agnes calling me from on the surf--
GRU => Totally in!
EL MACHO => You know what? I am not so convinced that he is in.
KEVIN => Blah!
GRU => Edith!   Agnes!      Come on!
GRU => Ooof!

EL MACHO => Pollito!   What's the matter?
LUCY => Oh, hey!   Eduardo!
EL MACHO => Lucia! I apologize. Pollito, he's usually not like this. The same thing happened the other day with... with Gru and...
LUCY => Oh, speaking of Gru...uh, have you seen him? I really need to talk to him.
EL MACHO => Yes, I think he's somewhere around here. You two are close, no?
LUCY => Oh, I don't know. I mean close... I wouldn't say we were close. Why, did he say we were close? Did he say that? DESPICABLE ME 2             CINCO & KEN DRAFT      87.
EL MACHO => It's more what he didn't say. For instance, he never mentioned...that you were both working for the Anti- Villain League!!!
EL MACHO =>  You're coming with me.
LUCY => Hey!
DR. NEFARIO => Crikey.
EDITH => So Eduardo's actually El Macho? Cool!
GRU => No, it is not cool. Plus, I pretty much knew it was him all along, so if anyone's cool, it's me.
DR. NEFARIO =>  Gru!
GRU => Well, Dr. Nefario... DESPICABLE ME 2              CINCO & KEN DRAFT    88.

GRU => Lucy? Wha--that's impossible! She's on her way to Australia...
EL MACHO => Nefario!
DR. NEFARIO => Sorry, gotta go!
