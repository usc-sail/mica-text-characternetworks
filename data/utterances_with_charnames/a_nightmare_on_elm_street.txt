VOICE => One two, Freddie's coming for you...
WOMAN => You okay, Tina?
TINA => Just a dream, Ma...  Damn dream, is all...
TINA'S MOTHER => Some dream, judging from that.
MAN =>  You coming back to the sack or what?
TINA'S MOTHER => Hold your horses. (lower, to Tina as she stands to leave) You gotta cut your nails or stop that kind of dreaming, Tina.  One or the other.
TINA =>  Oh, shit.
CHILDREN =>  One two, Freddie's coming for you... Three four better lock your door Five six grab your crucifix...
ROPE JUMPERS => Seven eight, gonna stay up late! Nine ten -- never sleep again!
TINA =>  That's what it reminded me of -- that old jump rope song.  Worst nightmare I ever had. You wouldn't believe it.
NANCY => Matter of fact I had a bad dream last night myself...
ROD =>  Had a hardon this morning when I woke up, Tina.  Had your name written all over it.
TINA => There's four letters in my name, Rod.  How could there be room on your joint for four letters?
ROD => Hey, up yours with a twirling lawn mower!
TINA => Rod says the sweetest things.
NANCY => He's nuts about you.
TINA => Yeah, nuts.
TINA =>  Anyway, I'm too tired to worry about the creep.  Couldn't get back to sleep at all.  So what you dream?
NANCY => Forget it, the point is, every- body has nightmares once in a while. No biggy.
GLEN => Next time you have one, just tell yourself that's just all it is, right while you're having it, y'know?  That's the trick. Once you do that, you wake right up.  At least it works for me.
TINA => Hey!  You have a nightmare too?
TINA => Maybe we're gonna have the Big Earthquake.  They say things get weird just before that...
TINA => I can't believe his mother let him come over here.
NANCY => Right.  Well, she didn't, exactly...
GLEN =>  See, I got this cousin who lives near the airport, that it's okay for me to stay with, right?  So I found this sound effects tape at Licorice Pizza, and...
GLEN => Hello, Mom?  Yeah, out here at Barry's.
GLEN => Huh?  Yeah, noisy as usual.  Glad we don't live here -- huh?  Yeah, Aunt Eunice says hello.
GLEN =>  Right, right -- I'll call you in the morning!  Right!  Huh?  Yeah, sure, I, huh?...
GLEN =>  Uh... some kid's drag racing outside, I think...
GLEN => Listen, Mom, I got to go -- I think there's been an accident out front -- I --
GLEN => Right.  I'll call the police.  No, just some neighbors having a fight, I guess.  I'm fine, I'm fine! Call you in the morning!
NANCY => Worked like a charm.
GLEN => Jesus.
NANCY => Nice to have a fire.
TINA => Really.  Turn 'er up a little.
NANCY => Maybe we should call Rod, have him come over too.  He might get jealous.
TINA => Rod and I are done.  He's too much of a maniac.
GLEN => He should join the Marines, they could make something out of him. Like a hand grenade.
NANCY => See?  You've forgotten the bad dream.  Didn't I tell you?
TINA => All day long I been seeing that guy's weird face, and hearing those fingernails...
NANCY => Fingernails?  That's amazing, you saying that. It made me remember the dream I had last night.
TINA => What you dream?
NANCY => I dreamed about this guy in a dirty red and yellow sweater; I dream in color, y'know; he walked into the room I was in, right, right through the wall, like it was smoke or something, and just stared at me.  Sort of ...obscenely.  Then he walked out through the wall on the other side.  Like he'd just come to check me out...
TINA =>  So what about the fingernails?
NANCY => He scraped his fingernails along things -- actually, they were more like fingerknives or something, like he'd made them himself?  Anyway, they made this horrible nose --  sssssccrrrtttt....
TINA => Nancy.  You dreamed about the same creep I did, Nancy...
GLEN => That's impossible.
TINA => What?
GLEN => Nothing.
TINA => There's somebody out there, isn't there...
NANCY => I didn't hear anything...
GLEN => I'm gonna punch out your ugly lights, whoever you are.
GLEN => It's just a stupid cat.
NANCY => Then bring us back its tail and whiskers.
TINA => Anyway, I don't have a cat...
GLEN => Kitty-kitty?  Chow chow chow?
ROD => And it's number thirty-six, Rod Lane, bringing Lantz down just three yards from the goal with a brilliant tackle!  And the fans go wild!
TINA => What the hell you doing here?
ROD => Came to make up, no big deal. Your ma home?
TINA => Of course.  What's that?
ROD => Intense, huh?  So what's happening, an orgy or something?
GLEN => Maybe a funeral, you dickhead.
NANCY => -- Just a sleep-over date, Rod. Just Tina and me.  Glen was just leaving.
ROD => You see his face?  Your ma ain't home, is she?  Me and Tina got stuff to discuss.
NANCY => Rod...
ROD => We got her mother's bed. You two got the rest.
NANCY => We should get her out of here...
TINA => Hey -- you guys're hanging around -- right?  Don't leave me alone with this lunatic -- Pleeeeze, NANCY!
GLEN => So we'll guard her together. Through the night.  In each others' arms like we always said.
NANCY => Glen.  Not now.  I mean, we're here for Tina now, not for ourselves.
GLEN =>  Why's she so bothered by a stupid nightmare, anyway?
NANCY => Because he was scary, that's why.
GLEN => Who was scary?
NANCY => Don't you think it's weird, her and me dreaming about the same guy? (GLEN looks away; NANCY stares closer) You didn't have a bad dream last night, did you?
GLEN => Me?  I don't dream.
GLEN => Morality sucks.
TINA => I knew there was sometihng about you I liked...
ROD => You feel better now, right?
TINA => Jungle man fix Jane.
ROD => No more fights?
TINA => No more fights.
ROD =>  Good.  No more nightmares for either of us then.
TINA =>  When did you have a nightmare?
ROD =>  Guys can have nightmares too, y'know.  You ain't got a corner on the fucking market or something.
TINA =>  Where'd you get this snotty old thing?
TINA => ROD...
TINA =>  Who the fuck you think you are, whoever you are?
TINA =>  Somebody there?
VOICE =>  Tina.
TINA => Who the hell is that?
TINA => Oh, shit, please God...
KILLER =>  This is God...
TINA => Nancy!  Open the door -- Nancy!
MAN => She's still awake.  Nancy can't hear you.
ROD => T-tina!?
ROD => What the hell's going ON here! Tina!
ROD => Tina --
ROD => You motherfucker!  I'll kill you for that!
GLEN => What the hell's going on!?
NANCY => Oh -- jeez -- Glen!  Rod's gone ape!
ROD =>  I'll kill you!
GLEN => Rod?  Rod, you better not hurt Tina...
GLEN => You okay?
NANCY => Yeah.  Something slippering all over here...  Tina?
GLEN => Oh, shit...
GLEN =>  I...I'm gonna call the cops --
PARKER => Lieutenant Thompson.  Sorry to wake you, but --
LT THOMPSON => I'd've canned your ass if you hadn't.  What you got?
PARKER => Her name was Tina Gray.  It was her home.  Father abandoned ten years ago, mother's in Vegas with a boyfriend.  We're trying to reach her now.
LT THOMPSON => What's the Coroner got to say?
PARKER => Something like a razor was the weapon, but nothing found on the scene.
SERGEANT GARCIA =>  Leautenant.  You know who --
LT THOMPSON => Where is she?
SERGEANT GARCIA => I put her in your office...
PARKER => Looks like her boyfriend did it.  Rod Lane.  Musician type, arrests for brawling, dope --
LT THOMPSON => Terrific.  What the hell was she doing there?
PARKER => She lived there.
LT THOMPSON => OMIT 37.              I don't mean her --                           OMIT 37.
LT THOMPSON => I mean you.  What the hell was she doing there?
MARGE => Hello to you, too, Donald.
LT THOMPSON => Marge.
LT THOMPSON => How you doing, pal?
NANCY => Okay.  Hi, dad.
LT THOMPSON => I don't want to get into this now, god knows you need time.  But I'd sure would like to know what the hell you were doing shacked up with three other kids in the middle of the night -- especially a delinquent lunatic like Lane.
NANCY => Rod's not a lunatic.
LT THOMPSON => You got a sane explanation for what he did?
MARGE => Apparantly he was crazy jealous. Nancy said they'd had a fight, Rod and Tina.
NANCY =>  It wasn't that serious...
MARGE => Maybe you don't think murder's serious --
NANCY => She was my best friend!  Don't you dare say I don't take her death seriously!  I just meant their fights weren't that serious.
NANCY =>  She dreamed this would happen...
LT THOMPSON => What?
NANCY => She had a nightmare about somebody trying to kill her, last night. That's why we were there; she was afraid to sleep alone.
MARGE => She's been through enough for one night.  You have her statement.
LT THOMPSON =>  I suggest you keep a little better track on her -- she's still a kid, y'know.
MARGE => You think I knew there were boys there!?  You try raising a teenager alone.
LT THOMPSON =>  See they get home okay.
TV NEWSCASTER => In the headlines this morning -- a local teenage girl was brutally murdered during an all-night party.
TV NEWSCASTER => Police say the victim, fifteen-year -old Christina Grey, had quarrelled earlier with her boyfriend, Rod Lane, a punk rocker with a history of delinquency.  Lane is now the subject of a city-wide manhunt. According to --
MARGE =>  Where you think you're going?
NANCY => School.
MARGE => I could hear you tossing and turning all night, kiddo.  You've no business going to school.
NANCY => I gotta go to school, Mom. Please.  Otherwise I'll just sit up there and go crazy or something.
MARGE => Did you sleep?
NANCY => I'll sleep in study hall, promise. I'd rather keep busy, you know?
MARGE => Right home after.
NANCY => Right home after.  See you.
ROD => I'm not gonna hurt you.
ROD => Your old man thinks I did it, don't he?
NANCY => He doesn't know you.  Couldn't you change?
ROD => The cops were all over my house.  They'll kill me for sure.
NANCY => Nobody's gonna kill you.
ROD => I never touched her.
NANCY => You were screaming like crazy.
ROD => Someone else was there.
NANCY => The door was locked from your side.
ROD => Don't look at me like I'm some kind of fucking fruitcake or something, I'm warning you.
VOICE => Morning, Mr. Lane.
LT THOMPSON => Now just step away from her, son. Like your ass depended on it. I'm warning you.
NANCY => No!
THOMPSON => Jesus -- are you crazy!?
ROD => I didn't do it -- !  I didn't kill her, Nancy!
NANCY => You used me, daddy!
LT THOMPSON =>  What the hell you doing going to school today, anyway -- your mother told me you didn't even sleep last night!
LT THOMPSON => Nancy!  Hey!
TEACHER => According to Shakespeare, there was something operating in Nature, perhaps inside human nature itself, that was rotten -- a canker, as he put it.
TEACHER => Of course Hamlet's response to this, and to his mother's lies, was to continually probe and dig -- just like the gravediggers -- always trying to get beneath the surface.  The same was true in a different way in Julius Caesar. Jon, go ahead...
SURFER =>  Uh, In the most high and palmy state of Rome...
WISEGUY STUDENT => California's the most high and palmy state, man.
ENGLISH TEACHER => Can it.
SURFER => In the most high and palmy state of Rome, a little ere the mightiest Julius fell... (NANCY's head pitches forward; she jerks it back up, barely awake) The graves stood tenantless, and the sheeted dead did squeak and gibber in the Roman street...
TINA => Nancy.
SURFER => O God, I could be bounded in a nutshell and count myself a king of infinite space, were it not that I have bad dreams...
TINA =>  Nancy.
NANCY => Tina!
HALLGUARD => Y-you're not supposed to run. W-where's your pass -- you got a pass?
NANCY => Screw your stupid pass!
HALLGUARD => Hey, no running in the halls!
NANCY => Tina?
NANCY => Who are you?
MAN => Gonna get you.
TEACHER => Okay -- Okay, Thompson!  Every- thing's all right now -- Nancy!.
TEACHER => I'll call your mother.
NANCY => No!  No, really, I'm fine.  I'll go straight home.  I'm okay.
TEACHER => You'll need a hall pass!
OMIT 61A. => 62.   But she shakes herself silent.  Wipes the tears away with a slash  62. of sleeve.  She rubs her arm absently, lost in thought, then reacts in surprise and pain.  She lifts her arm and stares at the spot she's touched.
TINA => Couldn't get back to sleep at all.  What you dream?
NANCY => My dad here?
SERGEANT GARCIA => Lieutenant.
LT THOMPSON => Decide to take a day off after all?
NANCY => Dad, I want to see Rod Lane.
LT THOMPSON => Only family allowed, Nancy.  You know the drill.
NANCY => Just want to talk to him a second.
LT THOMPSON => He's dangerous.
NANCY => You don't know he did it.
LT THOMPSON => No, I know, thanks to your own testimony, that he was locked in a room with a girl who went in alive and came out in a rubber bag.
NANCY => I just want to talk to him.  Please, Dad.
LT THOMPSON => Make it fast.
NANCY =>  And then what happened?
ROD => I told you.  It was dark, but I'm sure there was someone else IN there, under the covers with her.
NANCY => How could somebody get under the covers with you guys without you knowing it?
ROD => How the fuck do I know?  I don't expect you to believe me.
NANCY => What he look like?  You get a look at him?
ROD => No.
NANCY => Well then how can you say somebody else was there?
ROD => Because somebody cut her.  While I watched.
NANCY => Somebody cut her while you watched and you don't know what he looked like?
ROD => You couldn't see the fucker. You could just see the cuts happening, all at once.
NANCY => What you mean 'all at once'?
ROD =>  I mean, it was as if there were four razors cutting her at the same time.  But invisible razors. She just... opened up...
NANCY => Rod!
ROD => I probably could've saved her if I'd moved sooner...  But I thought it was just another nightmare, like the one I had the night before.  There... was this guy who had knives for fingers...
ROD => Do you think I did it?
NANCY => No.
MARGE => Nancy, don't fall asleep in there.
NANCY => I won't.
MARGE => Get into bed.
NANCY => I will.
MARGE => Nancy?
NANCY => What?
MARGE =>  You're not falling asleep, are you?  You could drown, you know.
NANCY => Mother, for petesakes.
MARGE => It happens all the time.  I've got some warm milk all ready for you.  Why don't you jump into bed?  I'm gonna turn on your electric blanket, too.  C'mon, now. (then she's gone into another room)
NANCY =>  Warm milk.  Gross.
NANCY => One, two, Freddie's coming for you, three four, better lock your door, five six, grab your crucifix, seven eight gonna stay up late, nine ten, never sleep again...
MARGE => Nancy!  NANCY!
NANCY => Mommy!
MARGE => I told you!  Hundreds of people a year drown like that!
MARGE => You okay?
NANCY => Great
MARGE =>  To bed with you, c'mon.
MARGE => No television, forget the homework, no phone calls.
NANCY => No, Mother.  Yes, Mother. No, Mother.
MARGE => And no school tomorrow, either. you take a little vacation, relax and rest for a change.
NANCY => Yes, Mother.  G'night.
MARGE => Take this, it'll help you sleep.
NANCY => Right.
MARGE => Sleep tight, don't let the bedbugs bite.
GLEN => Sorry!  Saw your light on. Thought I'd see how you were.
NANCY => Sometimes I wish you didn't live right across the street.
GLEN => Shut up and let me in.  You ever stand on a rose trellis in your bare feet?
NANCY => If you don't mind.
GLEN => So.  I heard you freaked out in English class today.
NANCY => Guess I did.
GLEN => Haven't slept, have you?
NANCY => Not really.
GLEN => You look dead and rained on, if you want the ugly truth.  And what you do to your arm?
NANCY => Burned myself in Englsh class.
NANCY => M'god, I look twenty years old.  You have any weird dreams last night?
GLEN => Slept like a rock.
NANCY =>  Well at least I have an objective wall to bounce this off.  You believe it's possible to dream about what's going to happen?
GLEN => No.
NANCY => You believe in the Boogey Man?
GLEN => One two, Freddie's coming for you?  No.  Rod killed Tina. he's a fruitcake and you know it.
NANCY => You believe in anything?
GLEN => I believe in you, me, and Rock and Roll.  And I'm not too sure about you lately.
NANCY => Listen, I got a crazy favor to ask.
GLEN => Uh-oh...
NANCY => It's nothing too hard or anything.  I'm just going to... LOOK for someone, and... I want you to be sort of a ...guard. Okay?
NANCY => Okay?
GLEN => Okay, okay.  I think.
NANCY => You won't screw up, right?  I mean, a whole lot might depend on it.
GLEN => Okay, I won't screw up.
GLEN => Jesus, it's dark in here.
NANCY => Shhh.  Now listen, here's what we're gonna do...
NANCY =>  You still there?
GLEN => Yeah.  So?
NANCY => Just checking -- keep out of sight!
NANCY => Still there?
GLEN =>  Still here!
NANCY => On your toes, right?
NANCY => Glen.
NANCY =>  Glen?!
NANCY => GLEN!
NANCY => Rod!  Look out!
NANCY => Glen!!
NANCY => I swear...
NANCY => Glen, where are you!  Wake up! Glen!
NANCY => Glen!  Glen!!!
NANCY => Glennn!!!
NANCY => Glen, you bastard...
GLEN => What I do?
NANCY =>  I asked you to do just one thing. Just stay awake and watch me -- Just wake me if it looked like I was having a bad dream.  But you.  You shit -- what do you do -- you fall asleep!
NANCY =>  I must be going nuts...
MARGE => Nancy?
GLEN => Oh, shit.
NANCY => Yes, mother?
MARGE =>  You okay?
NANCY =>  Yeah.  Just had a little dream. I'm falling right back to sleep.
MARGE =>  Okay... You need anything, just call.
NANCY => Okay.
GLEN => You mind telling me what's going on?
GLEN => Oh, I see.  That makes it all perfectly clear.
NANCY => Garcia, I want to see Rod Lane again.
SGT GARCIA => I thought when I took the night shift I'd have peace and quiet for a change.
NANCY => It's urgent, we've gotta see Rod.
SGT GARCIA => It's three in the morning. Your mother know you're out this late?
NANCY =>  Of course -- look, at least go back and look at him.  Just see if he's okay.
GLEN =>  We have reason to think there might be something weird going on.
LT THOMPSON => Oh, no argument on that.
NANCY => Dad -- what you doing here?
LT THOMPSON => It so happens I work here, and there's an unsolved murder.  I don't like unsolved murders, especially ones my daughter's mixed up in -- what are you doing here at this hour?  You're supposed to be getting some sleep.
GLEN => Listen, sir, this is serious. Nancy had a nightmare about Rod being in danger, or something, and so she thinks...
NANCY => I just want to see if he's okay!
SGT GARCIA => Take my word for it, Nancy.  The guy's sleeping like a baby.  He's not going anywhere.
NANCY => This isn't your average nightmare, Daddy -- damn it!
LT THOMPSON => Now look, Nancy, don't push it.  You've already rubbed my nose in sex, drugs and violence -- don't start throwing in insanity!
NANCY => Just go back and check -- please!
LT THOMPSON => Okay, Garcia.  What the hell.
SGT GARCIA => Right...  Now where'd I put the key...
NANCY => Rod!
LT THOMPSON => Gimme a hand, dammit!
SGT GARCIA => Goddamn loco kid -- he didn't have t'do that -- Madre dios!
LT THOMPSON => How'd you know he was gonna do this?
MINISTER => Ashes to ashes, dust to dust. May God be with this young man's soul.
MINISTER => His life and his death attest to the Scripture's warning that he who lives by the sword shall die by the sword.
MINISTER => But let us recall also our Lord's admonition that we 'Judge not, lest we be judged.'  Let us attempt only to love.  And may Rod Lane rest in peace.
NANCY =>  Amen to that much.
LT THOMPSON => How's Nancy doing?
MARGE => I don't think she's slept since Tina died.  She's always been a delicate kid.
LT THOMPSON => She's tougher than you think. Any idea how she knew Rod was gonna kill himself?
MARGE => No.  All I know is, this reminds me too much of ten years ago.
LT THOMPSON => Yeah.  Well... Let's not start digging up bodies just because we're in a cemetery.
MARGE =>  Time to go home, baby.
NANCY => The killer's still loose, you know.
LT THOMPSON => You saying somebody else killed Tina?  Who?
NANCY => I don't know who he is.  But he's burned, he wears a weird hat, a red and yellow sweater, real dirty, and he uses some sort of knifes he's got made into a sort of... glove.  Like giant finger- nails.
LT THOMPSON =>  I think you should keep Nancy at home a few days.  'Til she's really over the shock.
MARGE => I got something better...  I'm gonna get you help, baby. So no one will threaten you any more.
NANCY => But I just don't feel... ready to sleep yet.  Please, do I have to?
DR KING => Don't worry, you're not gonna change into Bride of Frankenstein or anything.
DR KING => Nancy have any severe childhood illnesses?  Scarlet Fever? High temperatures -- concussions?
MARGE => No, nothing.
NANCY => He means, did you ever drop me on my head.
DR KING => Nightmares are expected after psychological trauma.  Don't worry, they go away.
MARGE => I sure as hell hope so.
NANCY => I don't see why you couldn't just give me a pill to keep me from dreaming...
DR KING => Everyone's got to dream. If you don't dream, you go... (he drills his finger at his temple) All set?
NANCY => No.
MARGE => They're just simple tests, Nan.  We'll both be right here.
DR KING => Look, I know it's been fright- ening, I know your dreams have seemed real.  But... it's okay.  Okay?
MARGE => Please, Nancy.  Trust us.
NANCY => It's not you I don't trust. It's...  Okay.  Let's do it.
DR KING => How long's this been going on?
MARGE => Since the murder.  She was fine before that.
DR KING => Not to worry.  No signs of path- ology in Nancy's EEG or pulse rate.  I'd guess what we've got is a normal young girl who just happens to have gone through two days of hell.
MARGE => It's just made her think... her dreams are real...
DR KING => Ever hear the old Buddhist tale about the King who dreamed he was a beggar who dreamed he was a king?
DR KING => Okay, good.  She's asleep.
MARGE =>  Thank God.
MARGE => What the hell are dreams, anyway?
DR KING => Mysteries.  Incredible body hookus pokus.  Truth is we still don't know what they are or where they come from. As for nightmares...  Did you know that in the last three years twenty Philipino refugees in California died in the middle of nightmares? Not from heart attacks, either. They just died.
MARGE => What happened?  That needle sank like a rock.
DR KING =>  She's entering deep sleep now. Heart rate's a little high due to anxiety, but otherwise she's nicely relaxed.  All normal. She could dream at any time now.  Right now she's like a diver on the bottom of an ocean no one's mapped yet.  Waiting to see what shows up.
DR KING => Okay, she's started to dream.
MARGE => How can you tell?
DR KING => R.E.M.'s.  Rapid eye movements. The eyes follow the dream -- their movement picks up on this --
DR KING => Beta Waves are slowing, too. She's dreaming, all right. A good one, too.
DR KING => Typical dream parameter.  A nightmare, now, would be plus or minus five or six; she's just around three point --
MARGE => What the hell's this?  She awake or asleep?
DR KING => Can't be.  It never gets this high...
DR KING => Jesus H. Christ.
MARGE => NANCY!!!  IT'S MOM -- NANCY!!!!
DR KING => Now, this is just going to let you relax and sleep, Nan --
NANCY => No.  That's enough sleep.
DR KING => Okay, kid.  Okay.  Fair enough.
MARGE => Oh my god, oh my god...
DR KING =>  Get the kit!
NANCY => You believe this?
MARGE =>  Where the hell did you get that?
NANCY => I grabbed it off his head.
MARGE => She said she snatched it off his head in a dream.  No, I'm not crazy, I've got the damn thing in my hand!  I know we did, we all... (hears NANCY approaching) Gotta go.
MARGE => You didn't sleep, did you? The doctor says you have to sleep or you'll --
NANCY => Go even crazier?
MARGE => I don't think you're going crazy -- and stop drinking that damn coffee!
NANCY => Did you ask Daddy to have the hat examined?
MARGE => I threw that filthy thing away -- I don't know what you're trying to prove with it, but --
NANCY => What I learned at the dream clinic, that's what I'm trying to prove.  Rod didn't kill Tina, and he didn't hang himself. It's this guy -- he's after us in our dreams.
MARGE => But that's just not reality, Nancy!
NANCY => It's real, Mamma.  Feel it.
MARGE =>  Put that damned thing down!
NANCY => His name is even in it -- written right in here -- Fred Krueger -- Fred Krueger!  You know who that is, Mamma?  You better tell me, cause now he's after me!
MARGE => Nancy, trust your mother for once -- you'll feel better as soon as you sleep!
NANCY => You call this feeling better? Or should I grab a bottle and veg out with you -- avoid everything happening to me by just getting good and loaded --
MARGE =>  Fred Krueger can't be after you, Nancy -- he's dead!
MARGE =>  Fred Krueger is dead.  Dead and gone.  Believe me, I know.  Now go to bed.  I order you, go to bed.
NANCY => You knew about him all this time, and you've been acting like he was someone I made up!
MARGE => You're sick, Nancy.  Imagining things.  You need to sleep, it's as simple as that.
NANCY => Screw sleep!
MARGE => Nancy!
MARGE => Nancy -- it's only a nightmare!
NANCY => That's enough!
GLEN => Whenever I get nervous I eat.
NANCY => And if you can't do that, you sleep.
GLEN => Used to.  Not anymore.
GLEN => You ever read about the Balinese way of dreaming?
NANCY => No.
GLEN => They got a whole system they call 'dream skills'.  So, if you have a nightmare, for instance like falling, right?
NANCY => Yeah.
GLEN => Instead of screaming and getting nuts, you say, okay, I'm gonna make up my mind that I fall into a magic world where I can get something special, like a poem or song.  They get all their art literature from dreams.  Just wake up and write it down.  Dreamskills.
NANCY => And what if they meet a monster in their dream?  Then what?
GLEN => They turn their back on it.  Takes away its energy, and it disappears.
NANCY => What happens if they don't do that?
GLEN =>  I guess those people don't wake up to tell what happens.
NANCY => Great.
GLEN => 'Booby Traps and Improvised Anti-personel Devices'!
NANCY => I found it at this neat survivalist bookstore on Ventura.
GLEN =>  Well what you reading it for?
NANCY => I'm into survival.
GLEN => She's starting to scare the living shit out of me.
FOREMAN => And the other...
MARGE => Where's your mask and gun?
FOREMAN => Don't bust my chops, lady. If the city found out I put 'em in without inside releases I'd loose my license.
NANCY => Oh gross...
NANCY => Mom, what's with the bars!?
NANCY => Oh, Mom...
MARGE => 'S'mine...
NANCY => What's with the bars?
MARGE => S'curity.
NANCY => Mom, I want to know what you know about Fred Krueger.
MARGE => Dead and gone.
NANCY => I want to know how, where -- if you don't tell me, I'm going to call daddy.
MARGE => Your father the cop.  That's a good one.  Forget Fred Krueger.  You don't want to know, believe me.
NANCY => I do want to know.  He's not dead and gone -- he's after me and if I sleep he'll get me! I've got to know!
MARGE => All right.
MARGE => You want to know who Fred Krueger was?  He was a filthy child killer who got at least twenty kids, kids from our area, kids we all knew.  It drove us all crazy when we didn't know who was doing it -- but it was even worse when they caught him.
MARGE => Oh lawyers got fat and the judge got famous, but someone forgot to sign the search warrant in the right place, and Fred Krueger was free, just like that.
NANCY => So he's alive?
MARGE => He wouldn've stopped.  The bastard would've got more kids first chance he got -- they found nearly ten bodies in his boiler room as it was.  But the law couldn't touch him.
MARGE => What was needed were some private citizens willing to do what had to be done.
NANCY =>  What did you do, mother?
MARGE => Bunch of us parents tracked him down after they let him go.  Found him in an old boiler room, just like before.  Saw him lying there in that caked red and yellow sweater he always wore, drunk an' asleep with his weird knives by his side...
NANCY =>  Go on...
MARGE => We poured gasoline all around the place, left a trail out the door, locked the door, then...
MARGE => WHOOSH!!!
MARGE =>  But just when it seemed not even the devil could live in there any more -- he crashed out like a banshee, all on fire -- swinging those fingerknives every which direction and screaming he... he was going to get us by killing all our kids...
MARGE => There were all those men, Nancy, even your father, oh yes, even him.  But none could do what had to be done -- Krueger rolling and screaming so loud the whole state could hear -- no one could take your father's gun and kill him good and proper except me.
MARGE => So he's dead Nan.  He can't get you.  Mommy killed him.
NANCY => Who was there?  Were Tina's parents there?  Were Rod's?
MARGE => Sure, and Glen's.  All of us. But that's in the past now, baby.  Really.  It's over.  We even took his knives.
MARGE => See?
NANCY => All these years you've kept those things buried down here?  In our own house?
MARGE => Proof he's declawed.  As for him, we buried him good and deep.
MARGE => So's okay, you can sleep.
GLEN => Hello?
NANCY => Hi.
GLEN => Oh.  Hi, how y'doing?
NANCY => Fine.  Stand by your window so I can see you.  You sound a million miles away.
NANCY => Much better.
GLEN => I heard your ma went ape at the security store today.  You look like the Prisoner of Zenda or something.  How long's it been since you slept?
NANCY => Coming up on the seventh day.  It's okay, I checked Guiness.  The record's eleven, and I'll beat that if I have to.  Listen, I... I know who he is.
GLEN => Who?
NANCY => The killer.
GLEN => You do?
NANCY => Yeah, and if he gets me, I'm pretty sure you're next.
GLEN => Me!?  Why would anyone want to kill me?!
NANCY => Don't ask -- just give me some help nailing this guy when I bring him out.
GLEN => Bring him out of what?
NANCY => My dream.
GLEN => How you plan to do that?
NANCY => Just like I did the hat.  Have a hold of the sucker when you wake me up.
GLEN => Me? (switching back to a more comfortable reality) Wait a minute, you can't bring someone out of a dream!
NANCY => If I can't, then you all can relax, because it'll just be a simple case of me being nuts.
GLEN => I can save you the trouble. You're nutty as a fruitcake. I love you anyway.
NANCY => Good, then you won't mind cold-cocking this guy when I bring him out.
GLEN => What!?
NANCY =>  You heard me.  I grab him in the dream -- you see me struggling so you wake me up.  We both come out, you cold cock the fucker, and we got him.  Clever, huh?
GLEN => You crazy?  Hit him with what?
NANCY => You're a jock.  You must have a baseball bat or something. Come to my window at midnight. And meanwhile...
GLEN =>  Meanwhile..?
NANCY => Meanwhile whatever you do don't fall asleep.  Midnight.
GLEN => Holy shit!  Midnight.  Baseball bats and boogemen.  Unfucking real.
COP => Lieutenant Thompson -- what you doing in at this time?
LT THOMPSON => Can't sleep, thought I'd come break up the poker game.
SERGEANT GARCIA => If it was any more quiet we could hear owls farting.
LT THOMPSON => Is quiet, isn't it?
SERGEANT GARCIA =>  How's your girl?
LT THOMPSON => She's sensible.  She'll sleep sooner or later.
MR LANTZ => You'd think they'd have some- thing 'bout the Lane kid hanging himself.
MRS LANTZ => Maybe we're all making more out of it than we should.
CARSON => I wouldn't touch that line with a ten foot pole.
MRS LANTZ => Glen?  you all right?
MRS LANTZ => Glen honey?
GLEN => Whuu?
MRS LANTZ => How can you listen to Carson and a record at the same time?
GLEN => Wasn't listening to the tube, just watching.  Miss Nude America's supposed to be on tonight.
MRS LANTZ => Well how you gonna hear what she says?
GLEN => Who cares what she says?
MRS LANTZ => You should get to sleep soon, Glen.  It's almost midnight. Goodness knows we've all had enough of a time the last few days...
GLEN => I will, Mom...in a while. You guys turning in?
MRS LANTZ => Pretty soon.
MARGE => We'll go away, take a vacation. Get your hair colored nice, the way it was.  No one will ever know.  This whole room smells of coffee, y'know?
MARGE => It's all over now, baby.  The nightmare's over.  Please.
NANCY => Okay.
NANCY => Night-night.
MRS LANTZ => Shouldn't stare.
MR LANTZ => Know what I think?  I think that kid's some kinda lunatic.
MRS LANTZ => Shouldn't say such a thing about the poor child.  If you mean the bars, Marge's just being cautious, her being alone and Nancy acting so nervous lately.
MR LANTZ => Well, she ain't gonna hang around our boy no more.
NANCY =>  Hang on GLEN...
GLEN => Well, I'm not gonna risk sneaking out until she does.
MR LANTZ => Who at this hour?
MRS LANTZ => Hello? (listens, frowns slightly) Oh... Hold on.  It's her.  She wants to talk to Glen.
MR LANTZ =>  About what?
MRS LANTZ =>  What's this about, Nancy?
MRS LANTZ => She says it's private.  Very private and very important.
MR LANTZ => Glen's asleep.  Talk to him tomorrow!
MR LANTZ => Just got to be firm with kids, is all.
NANCY => Glen.  Don't fall asleep...
NANCY => Glen?
NANCY => Brilliant.  Now what if Glen calls?
NANCY => Hello?
KRUEGER =>  I'm your boyfriend now...
NANCY => I'm awake, I am awake.  This is not a dream!  I am --
NANCY => My boyfriend...!
VOICE => Locked.
NANCY =>  Give me the key, mother.
MARGE => I don't even have it on me, so forget it.
MARGE =>  Paid the guy damn good to make sure you stayed put.  You ain't goin' nowhere, kid.  You're gonna sleep tonight if it kills me.
NANCY => GLEEENNNNNN!
NANCY => Glen!!  Don't fall asleeeeeep!
NANCY => Okay, Krueger, you bastard. We play in your court.
PARKER => Lieutenant.  It's your daughter. Says it's urgent.
LT THOMPSON =>  Tell her I'm not here, tell her...
PARKER => Uh, she just saw you, sir...
LT THOMPSON => Hello Nancy.
NANCY => Hi daddy.  I know what happened.
LT THOMPSON => Then you know more than I do -- I haven't even been upstairs.
NANCY =>  You know he's dead though, right?
LT THOMPSON => Yeah, apparantly he's dead. How the hell'd you know?
NANCY => I've got a proposition for you.  Listen very carefully, please.
LT THOMPSON => Nan, I --
NANCY => Please.  I'm gonna go get the guy who did it and bring him to you.  I just need you be right there to arrest him. Okay?
LT THOMPSON => Just tell me who did it and I'll go get him, baby.
NANCY => Fred Krueger did it, Daddy, and only I can get him.  It's my nightmare he comes to.
LT THOMPSON => Where'd you hear about Krueger --
NANCY => -- I want you to come over here and break the door down exactly twenty minutes from now -- can you do that?
LT THOMPSON => Sure, but...
NANCY => That'll be exactly half past midnight.  Time for me to fall asleep and find him.
LT THOMPSON => Sure, sure, honey.  You just do that -- get yourself some sleep -- that's what I've been saying all along.
NANCY => And you'll be here to catch him, right?
PARKER => Lieutenant -- they're waiting upstairs.
LT THOMPSON => Sure, okay, I'll be there. Now you just turn in and get some rest, sweetheart.  Please. Deal?
NANCY => Deal.
LT THOMPSON => Get outside and watch her house. If you see anything funny call me.
PARKER => 'Anything funny' like what?
LT THOMPSON => I don't know -- but one thing for sure, I don't want her coming over here.  She's way too far gone to be able to to handle this.
COP =>  What the hell did that, Lieutenant?  There ain't even a head left.
LT THOMPSON => Goddamed if I know.  What's the Coronor say?
COP => He's in the john puking since he saw it.
MARGE => Guess I should'n'a done it.
NANCY => Just sleep now, Mom.
MARGE => Just wanted to protect you, Nan.  Just wanted to protect you...
NANCY => Now I lay me down to sleep, I pray the Lord my soul to keep. If I should die before I wake, I pray the Lord my soul to take.
LT THOMPSON => I know it's hard to think at a time like this, Walter, but can you think of anyone who could've done such a thing?
MR LANTZ => He done it.
LT THOMPSON => Who?  Who did that?
MR LANTZ => Krueger.
LT THOMPSON => Krueger?
MR LANTZ => Had to've done it.  No one else was in there.
LT THOMPSON => How you know that?
MR LANTZ => Cause I thought Glen was gonna sneak out to see your lunatic daughter, that's why. So I locked him in his room!  Sorry.  Anyways, the door was still locked when we heard the screams.
MR LANTZ => Maybe god's punishing us all...
LT THOMPSON =>  Keep your head -- this is a fucking flesh and blood killer we're talking about.
MR LANTZ => Like Rod Lane?
COP => Lieutenant Thompson.  Coronor wants to show you something.
NANCY =>  Come out and show yourself, you bastard.
NANCY => I'm crazy after all...
NANCY => Help!  Hey -- Daddy -- I got him trapped!  Where are you!?
PARKER =>  Everything's going to be all right!  Everything's under control!
NANCY => Get my father, you asshole!
PARKER => You heard what I said!  Now get back inside or I'll tell your dad!
MARGE => No!
behind. => Drunk though she is, is hanging onto KRUEGER'S weapon hand, keeping the knives inside herself, away from her daughter!
MARGE => Nancy -- for god's sake's run!
NANCY => Daddy!  Where are you!
PARKER => Poor woman's got her hands full with that kid.  Maybe I better tell the lieutenant.
NANCY => Hey fuckface -- can't catch me!
NANCY =>  Come on -- he's in here! Daddy!  Don't let him kill me too!
NANCY => HEELLLPPP!!!  Daddyyyyyyy!!!!
NANCY => Hey -- Daddy!  Hey!  I got the bastard!
KRUEGER => Ready for these?
CORONER => Found you something, Donald. Should remind you of something...
CORONER => Only place I ever heard of such a thing before was ten years ago.  Remember that fucker Fred Krueger?
PARKER => Hey -- your daughter's acting kinda -- !  Strange...
NANCY => DAD!  GET US OUTTA HERE!
LT THOMPSON => Oh, Jesus -- Nancy!  Hey!  We got a fire!
NANCY => I got him -- I got Fred Krueger!
LT THOMPSON => What the hell are you talking about, Nancy?
NANCY => He's after Mom!  Come on!
LT THOMPSON => NANCY!
NANCY => He's under there!  Watch it!
NANCY => Now do you believe me?
PARKER => You find him? (looking closer at THOMPSON) Sir?
PARKER =>  Sir -- here, let me light that for you -- Lieutenant?  What happened? 
NANCY =>  I know you're there, Krueger.
FREDDIE => You think you was gonna get away from me?
NANCY => I know you too well now, Freddie.
FREDDY => And now you die...
NANCY => It's too late, Krueger.  I know the secret now -- this is just a dream, too -- you're not alive -- the whole thing is a dream -- so fuck off! I want my mother and friends again.
FREDDIE => You what?
NANCY =>  I take back every bit of energy I ever gave you. You're nothing.  You're shit.
NANCY =>  God, it's bright.
MARGE => Gonna burn off soon or it wouldn't be so bright.
NANCY => Feeling better?
MARGE => They say you've bottomed out when you can't remember the night before.  No more drinking, Baby, suddenly I just don't feel like it any more.
MARGE => Didn't keep you up last night, did I?  You look a little peeked.
NANCY => Nah.  Just slept heavy.
MARGE => See ya.
NANCY => See ya.
GLEN =>  You believe this fog?
MARGE =>  I believe anything's possible.
TINA => Lookin' good, girl!
GIRLS => One two -- Freddy's coming for you! Three four -- Better lock your door! Five six -- Get your Crucifix Seven eight -- Gonna stay up late! Nine ten -- Never sleep again!
