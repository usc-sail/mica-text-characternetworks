LOGAN => Wake up...come on, Logan-6.
FRANCIS  (shaking => his head in  mild, mocking disbelief) You are here. I  couldn't believe it when they told me. What are you doing?
FRANCIS => You should've seen me take my last Runner...perfect. (Logan  continues to pound the soundless glass) I backed him  up against a residence pool and  when he terminated...his hand... (breaks off as Logan is paying  no attention) So now you've seen him...what's the difference awake or asleep?
LOGAN => Open your eyes once, idiot.  It's not every  day that a Sandman son is  born. I'm telling you, Francis  - that's him!
FRANCIS => Maybe,  maybe not. What's the difference? Come on,  Logan, let's get out of  here before everybody  finds out.
FRANCIS => Okay...you really want to wake him up?
LOGAN => Hey, cut that out !
LOGAN => Now you've done it...
VOICE => Break-in scanners report intrusion, identify.
LOGAN => Logan-5...Francis-7, authorized duty quadrant. Intrusion accidental.
VOICE => Clear Logan-5 and Francis-7.
LOGAN => Even the alarm didn't wake him.
VOICE => Sleep time...go to sleep. Sleeping time, little ones.
FRANCIS => You need a lift. Let's go to Arcade and celebrate...  your alert successor...Logan-6.
LOGAN => Has anyone ever broken in to where the babies are?
FRANCIS =>  Not in my time...
FRANCIS (peering => at Logan curiously) Why?
LOGAN => just wondered...what happens?
FRANCIS => Dunno...flameout maybe. Whatever happens, you can bet it's final. But who would want to find out?
LOGAN => but you don't know, you Just say what everyone says.  One for one. One for one."
FRANCIS => Well, why no!? That's exactly how everything works. How else could the city stay in balance -You have a better idea?
LOGAN => No, but at least I wonder sometimes -- instead of doing that "one for one" song of yours. You sound like a sleepteacher With a stuck tape.
FRANCIS => Well the minute you get a better idea you can stop wondering.  You know, Logan -- you wonder a lot. Too much for a Sandman
MAN => Well? How do you like it?
WOMAN => I don't know. The cheeks maybe... look a little -
MAN => Cheeks? Cheeks? Right. Too much, you think?
WOMAN => Too little.
MAN => Too little?  Too little. Okay, wait for me.
LOGAN => Did you ever see Francis-8?
FRANCIS => I never even visited Nursery before tonight.  When you wonder, it slows you up -- you know?
FRANCIS => I don't know what makes you so curious. You have any idea who his seed-mother was?
LOGAN => Of course not! I m curious, not sick. 
FRANCIS => and that's my friend, Logan. (as she acknowledges the introduction) We're celebrating his next in line. Carousel - Arcade - who knows? Want to come along?
WOMAN => Only if I make it to the top of Carousel.  Thirty -- and the big spin.
FRANCIS => You're thirty -- already? I always thought I was older than you -  Well, give it a good try.
WOMAN => You know I always have.
2ND WOMAN => Sorry I won't be at Carousel tonight. Its  my Love-Shop turn.
WOMAN => That's all right. Happy turn.
2ND WOMAN => You'll renew. I've got a feeling.
WOMAN => So do I...but if I don't at least I'll have the ultimate thrill. I'd almost rather have that than renew.
2ND WOMAN => I feel the same way. Sometimes I think I'm not even going to try and renew when my time comes. But -- that's three years away. So long.
WOMAN => Um-huh.
FRANCIS => I guess you never had her?
FRANCIS => You missed something special.
LOGAN => Well...you can't have them all.
FRANCIS => The damned Yellows are getting out of hand. Those three ought to be in Cathedral. No business scrambling in Arcade...
LOGAN (laughs => cuffs Francis' arm) What an old, old man you're getting to be, Francis. Weren't you ever a Yellow? I bet you were even wilder than - (he breaks off as the lights in the Great Hall dim) -- come on, Sandman.
LOGAN => You should have been with us in Nursery, Daniel. I'm positive I  recognized him -
FRANCIS (hustling => Logan) Come on. I don't want to miss the filing-in. There'll be some I know tonight, I think...
FRANCIS => Damn! That's right. Just when I feel like an ALL OUT BLAST in Arcade .
LOGAN => Want me to take your shift? I'm feeling restless anyway
LOGAN => Now there's a few who could have been his seed-mother.
FRANCIS => Only a few? You're just not trying.
CROWD => Renew!
CROWD => Renew!
CROWD'S CHANT => Renew!
CROWD'S CHANT => Re...
LOGAN =>  Looks like I'm working.
LOGAN => Who invited you?
FRANCIS => I'm in my party mood.
59- => 59X11        WIDE ANGLE - A MAN
59X12- => 63X1            OUT
LOGAN => Runner terminated 0:31  Ready for cleanup.
LOGAN =>  That was a great shot you made.
FRANCIS => Yes.  But you look a little rusty to me -- what were you doing, wondering?
FRANCIS => ...Well I think you're getting stale. You need old Lucey--Go on. Gee the whole burn--try the new psycho-lift-they tell me it turns you inside out...
FRANCIS =>  I'll look for you here when I'm off--
63X19        LOGAN => Not with it. He turns and starts making his way downwards towards the exit.
LOGAN => What's wrong, Available?
JESSICA =>  Please . . .No.
LOGAN => Please . . . no ? (noting that she looks trapped, he understands) You mean "not here"--that's it? You're a private Available but particular, (he is moving in on her as he speaks, she retreating, which amuses him) Don't worry. There's no one here but me. And you.
JESSICA => No.  Just no.
LOGAN => You prefer women?
JESSICA => No.
LOGAN => Well then...?
JESSICA => Nothing. I felt sad, I put myself on the circuit. It was a mistake.
LOGAN => Sad? What made you sad?
JESSICA => A friend of mine went on Carousel tonight. Now he's gone.
LOGAN =>  Yes...probably he was renewed?
JESSICA =>  He was killed
LOGAN => Killed? Why do you use that word?
JESSICA => Isn't it right? Isn't that what you do? Kill.
LOGAN => I never 'killed' anybody in my life. Sandmen terminate  Runners  Who brought you?
JESSICA => Nobody. I felt sad. .. I put myself on the circuit.
LOGAN => You felt sad. What's your name?
JESSICA => Jessica.
LOGAN =>  You're beautiful. Let's have sex.
JESSICA => No.
LOGAN => Later.
JESSICA => No.
LOGAN => But you put yourself on the circuit!
JESSICA => I thought I had to do something.
LOGAN => And?
JESSICA => I changed my mind
LOGAN => And now?
JESSICA => Curious.
LOGAN => About what?
JESSICA => How a Sandman lives.
LOGAN => Let's have sex.  I thought you were curious.
JESSICA => Not about that.
LOGAN =>  I'm listening.
JESSICA => I'm afraid to tell you.
LOGAN =>  I'm not armed.  Well?
JESSICA => Why is it wrong to run?
LOGAN => You shouldn't even think such things...  And you picked a strange person to say them to -
JESSICA => I suppose. But what if you want to live?
LOGAN => So? Do what everyone does. Try like hell for renewal.
LOGAN => When this turns black...that's it.  If for any reason you want to be 31... you have the same chance as everyone else...Carrousel.
LOGAN => But if you're one of the misfits... that's where I come in.
JESSICA (somewhat => frightened) I didn't say that I would run... I Just...
LOGAN (interrupting; => turning over her palm) Are you a 5 or a 6? 
JESSICA => Six. I go red next year.
LOGAN => You're years away . . . I don't know why you're thinking of these things, much less talking about them.  Want to try?
LOGAN => What Quad do you live in?
JESSICA => K.
LOGAN => You're sure you don't want to try?
LOGAN => It's nice to know you can nod.
LOGAN => It's nice co know you can do that, too.
FRANCIS => These are for me -- you've got your own.  She must have been something--?
LOGAN => What happened to you?
SANDMAN => I lost a Runner in Cathedral.
LOGAN => How come?
SANDMAN => Ran into some Cubs I couldn't manage.  One of them cut me bad... (extends his arm and moves a finger from his shoulder to his wrist) all the way down.
FRANCIS =>  CUBS!
SANDMAN => On my way to the New You for repairs.
LOGAN => Get yourself a new face while you're at it They know you now.
64AX1- => 64BX1        OUT
LOGAN => I just might look in on New You 483 myself.
FRANCIS => You? Why? You're already beautiful.
LOGAN => No -- it's that last Runner -- someone in 483 was trying to help him.
SANDMAN => What's with you, Francis?
CLEAR => FRANCIS-7
FRANCIS => See you in the hydrotoner!
LOGAN => Negative. Question: What is it?
PREMILLENNIAL SYMBOL. => NAME: ANKH. QUESTION: IDENTIFY CONCEPT SANCTUARY?
LOGAN => Negative.
LOGAN => I don't understand?
LOGAN => Question:
LOGAN => 1056 unaccounted for?!
LOGAN => Impossible!  Question: Maybe they weren't all Runners. Maybe most of them reached Life Renewal on Carousel.
NEGATIVE...UNACCOUNTED => CITIZENS 1056...
LOGAN => Question: None of them reached renewal?
LOGAN => But everyone believes that some....
ANSWER ZERO => UNACCOUNTED CITIZENS NUMBER 1056....LOGAN- 5 ASSIGNED TO LOCATE SANCTUARY AND REPORT....
LOGAN => Question: You mean nobody's ever been renewed?
AUTHORIZATION TO => PENETRATE CITY SEALS...
LOGAN => The Seal......  Question: The Seals? Go outside?! But there's nothing outside!
SANCTUARY DESTRUCT... => FIND DESTROY
LOGAN => I will.
LOGAN => Question:  What if I need help from another Sandman?
LOGAN => Question: I am six Red...how can I pretend to be approaching Lastday?
LOGAN => My Lifeclock...  Question: My Life--
LOGAN => Question:  Am I still six Red?
LOGAN => I know that but I had four more years  This means ten days to Lastday. Of course I will get the four years back, won't I?
LOGAN => Question: Do I get my four years back?
FRANCIS => What the hell took you so long?
LOGAN =>  Did you ever see anybody renew?
FRANCIS => I think you've been skulling out too much. First Nursery and now stupid questions.
LOGAN => Did you?
FRANCIS => Of course.
LOGAN => Anybody we know?
FRANCIS => Look....why don't you get into the water....you need it....more than I do.
LOGAN =>  I'm fine....  See you....
FRANCIS => At Carousel tonight?
LOGAN =>  Location...female Green Six... name Jessica...living in Quad K.
YOUNG SANDMAN => She says she's been here before...
LOGAN => She has.
JESSICA => You could have called me yourself.
LOGAN => But I wasn't sure you'd come.
JESSICA =>  Here I am.  Shall I come in?
LOGAN => I couldn't get you out of my mind.
JESSICA => I'm the most beautiful woman you've ever seen, I suppose?
LOGAN => Maybe...sure....
JESSICA => Thanks...but I have the choice.
LOGAN => Of course.
JESSICA => Then it's still no.
JESSICA => You can have any woman in the city. What do you really want?
LOGAN => You know
JESSICA => I don't believe you. There has to be more.
LOGAN => All right.
JESSICA => Why show me?
LOGAN => I'm going to run.
JESSICA (after => reacting) Why tell me?
LOGAN => You know something.
JESSICA => About running, dying what?
LOGAN => Both...running's what I'm interested in.
JESSICA => I know what everyone knows. Try like hell for Renewal. You have the same chance everyone else has.
LOGAN => It's different now. Help me.
JESSICA => How can I?
JESSICA => Where did you get that?
LOGAN => A Runner gave it to me.
JESSICA => And then you killed him, right?
LOGAN => I let him go...believe me.
JESSICA => I don't..
LOGAN => Speak to your friends for me, Jessica... please...
JESSICA => Please? What friends?
LOGAN =>  I don't have much time.
JESSICA => I never heard of a Sandman running . . . ever. . .
LOGAN => What can I do to make you believe me?
SECOND MAN => He's blinking...so what? Sandmen get old, too.
FIRST MAN => But what if he's telling the truth?
THIRD MAN => I say no. It's not worth the risk.
WOMAN => I absolutely agree. He's killed Runners for a decade. He has no feelings.
JESSICA => He was born a Sandman. He had no choice.
WOMAN => Neither do we.
1ST SANDMAN => Thanks, Francis.
1ST SANDMAN => Ah-h you love it. You're afraid you'll miss a really good Run.
SECOND MAN => If he believes you, he'll come.
JESSICA => Why Arcade Station?
SECOND MAN => Why? It's our only chance--kill him and get away in the crowd heading for the evening slaughter --
JESSICA => Right at the station itself?
MAN => No - just there - on the first level.  Don't look for us. We'll see you.
WOMAN => You don't seem quite sure, Jessica.  Can you do it? Will you?
THIRD MAN => Tonight?
JESSICA => Y-yes...if I can find him.
WOMAN => I think you can. Don't you?
WOMAN => I'm sorry. We all are. But he has heard about Sanctuary -- and that makes him dangerous to all of us.
SECOND MAN =>  We're counting on you.
LOGAN => Are you here to help me?
JESSICA => What do you need?
JESSICA => What're you going to do?
LOGAN => That's tomorrow.
JESSICA =>  I wish I could help you.
LOGAN =>  Maybe you'll chink of something...
JESSICA =>  I wish I knew what you think I know.
LOGAN => If you did know, you'd tell me.
JESSICA => Of course--
LOGAN => If you trusted me, you'd know.
JESSICA => We're coming to Arcade. - Shall we Relive together?
LOGAN => Tell me, Jessica.
1ST SANDMAN => Hey, Logan's got a mean one tonight-- why don't you--
106- => 106X1    OUT
LOGAN => A Runner...Cathedral. A woman.
JESSICA => You're not going, are you?
LOGAN => Why not? Maybe she'll help me. You won't. You'd better stay here.
107- => 109X1     OUT
110- => 120         OUT
LOGAN => Have you ever been through Cathedral?
LOGAN => They're like beasts. Wild.
JESSICA => Maybe they're angry because they're grown in meccano-breeders.
LOGAN (interrupting, => grimacing) Instead of what? Nine months inside a woman:  We're all raised the same but most of us don't become cubs in Cathedral.
JESSICA => Some people say children need human mothering.
LOGAN => Insane. Nurseries are better than any mother could be.
JESSICA => I'm only telling you what I've heard...  Haven't you ever wondered what your seed-mother was Like...?
LOGAN => Uh-uh.
JESSICA => I have.
LOGAN =>  When did you begin to question Lastday?
JESSICA => I don't remember exactly...except I was a Green.  What would you like to relive, Logan?
LOGAN => Let's see - how long has it been?
VOICE => Attention passengers. Cathedral Station is a personal risk area. Persons with business are warned to be careful.
JESSICA => I've never been in this quadrant.  Is that Arcade off there?
LOGAN => Let me go first. Sometimes they're waiting just inside there--to rush you when it opens...
LOGAN => Quickly now--
LOGAN => Just follow--no matter how it seems...
the corridor) => The Cubs. When they're flying on muscle there's  no way to catch up. Without the dazzle, they'd just go past us--  too fast
JESSICA => Muscle? I don't know that one.
LOGAN => It's unauthorized. No good for any- one over thirteen anyhow--shakes you to pieces--speeds everything up to a blur--  you can see what happens when some flying Cub tries to go through this on muscle--splat!
JESSICA => Don't be afraid.
JESSICA => What's your name?
MARY => I'm Mary 2.
JESSICA => Where do you live, Mary?
MARY => Here.
JESSICA => Why aren't you in Nursery?
MARY => I'm very smart.
JESSICA => When do you go up?
MARY => I never go upstairs. You're a nice old lady.
LOGAN =>  Not here. Might be a decoy.
LOGAN => Runner!
BILLY =>  Don't worry about her. We'll have that one later. Right now I think we've got a Runner and his pairup. And what a Runner!
A VOICE => We're going to have ourselves a time, we are. Right, Billy?!
LOGAN => I'm a Sandman!
BILLY => I cut up a Sandman yesterday.  They said I'd never get him...but I cut him up good, I did.
LOGAN => I feel sorry for you, boy!
BILLY => For me? Better feel sorry for your- self, Sandman!
LOGAN => No, for you! How old are you, Billy?
LOGAN => Fourteen? Fifteen? Your days are running out. How long can you last? A year. Six months? (he points to the yellow flower in Billy's palm) What happens when you're sixteen and you go green?
BILLY => Nothing will happen! I make the rules as I go!! Cubs do what I say! Always have! Always will! I got Cathedral and I'll never let go!
LOGAN => No cubs over fifteen, Billy! Ever heard of a cub with a green flower? You'll leave Cathedral then, Billy, when you're on green, because they won't let a green stay here.  If you try to stay the young ones will gut-rip you apart!
BILLY => Shut up! Shut up your damn mouth!
ANOTHER VOICE => Let him suck Muscle! That'll shut his mouth! Let's watch him shake himself to death!!
A VOICE => Give him some Muscle!!
ANOTHER VOICE => Shake him to death!!
A VOICE => Kill him!
BILLY => He's trying to hold his breath...
BILLY => We can rush him...we can take can take him    again, we can!!
LOGAN =>  All right! How many of you want this to be Lastday?!
LOGAN => Come on, Billy...come on...you cut a Sandman, didn't you?!
LOGAN => Come on, Billy...cut me...Come on
LOGAN =>  They've got someone else! Why would anybody come here?
WOMAN (nearing => hysteria) There's been a terrible error! My Lifeclock must have broken in some way!  I'm nowhere near thirty...look at me...I'm twenty-two. I should be green! Did you hear me?  Green!
LOGAN => Don't be afraid--
WOMAN => I'll kill you!! I'll kill you!!
LOGAN => I'm not going to hurt you.
LOGAN => Sanctuary? Anything?
LOGAN => If they find you throw this hard enough to break it. Then hold your breath till you get away...It's blind gas.
tone) => Runner!
FRANCIS => Runner terminated at G.16 Ready for cleanup at Cathedral Quadrant 39.
SECOND MAN => I almost believed her.
JESSICA => I'm ashamed. I was bringing you to be killed.
LOGAN => Where? Sanctuary? Can you take me there?
JESSICA => Logan, I don't know where Sanctuary is. But if I take you to them, they'll kill you.
LOGAN => All right. But why? I didn't kill the Runner.
JESSICA => Yes, but they won't know that...or care. They're hunting you, Logan. Maybe me too, now...
LOGAN => That's nothing...there's a Sandman behind us, too and there'll be more soon. Take me to them.
JESSICA => I - I can't.
LOGAN => Then - why don't you leave me - go to them - explain
JESSICA => No. Not that either.
LOGAN => All right. New You 483. I'll find out myself.
SANDMAN => What happened?!
FRANCIS => Can you beat it....I've got the damn wrong bag.
SANDMAN => You ought to put yourself on reliefcall, Francis.
FRANCIS => Yeah....
RECEPTIONIST => Hello, Sandman.
LOGAN => Hello.
RECEPTIONIST => Do you want to see Doc?
RECEPTIONIST => We don't get many Sandmen. I think we've only had one other since I've been here.
LOGAN => A Sandman can get as sick of his face as anyone else. Where's the doctor?
RECEPTIONIST => I like your face. Would you mind if Doc took a picture? I'd Like him to give your face to somebody else.
LOGAN => It's all right with me. Is he here?
RECEPTIONIST => My name's Holly...Holly 13. In ancient times they said my number was unlucky. Do you believe in luck?
LOGAN => No - Look, I'm in a hurry.
HOLLY => Doc'll be with you soon, Sandman.
WOMAN CUSTOMER => Is this your first time?
WOMAN CUSTOMER => This is my third...  ... I did it when I turned yellow ... and green.  I turned red yesterday.
LOGAN => Beautiful work. This man do them all?
WOMAN CUSTOMER => No. But I hear he's terrific. Have you seen any of his work?
LOGAN => Just one.
HOLLY => Doc's ready, Sandman.
DOC => It's a real privilege, Sandman.
LOGAN => Thanks.  I thought you'd be older. I ex- pected a Red.
LOGAN => Your own work?
DOC => And I did it myself right on there.
DOC => I designed it myself.  What'll it be ...a face job or a full-body job?
LOGAN => Just the face.
DOC => Fine....Holly will get you ready. You're in good hands, believe me.
DOC => Holly works here because she gets a lift out of watching the Table...  and other things. I'll be back in a minute.
HOLLY => He's going to sterilize himself.
LOGAN => Do I have to undress?
HOLLY => Not for your face.
DOC => You shouldn't have brought him here.
JESSICA; => I didn't bring him -- what's the difference. He's blinking. He wants to run.
DOC => Run!? He's a Sandman.
JESSICA => I tell you he's running. I know.
DOC => Maybe...Maybe. But I wish he'd gone somewhere else.  All right. He gets a face.
HOLLY =>  I like dark hair. Have him give you dark hair.
DOC => All set?
HOLLY => Um huh. Would you take a picture of him, Doc? I'd like you to give his face to somebody else.
DOC => Why not?
DOC => Do you have anything special in mind?
LOGAN => I don't care...Just get it over with.
DOC => Hurry...hurry...hurry.
HOLLY => Dark hair.
LOGAN => Holly'd like dark hair.
DOC => Holly'd like a lot of things.  We can start by narrowing the cheekbones.
DOC =>  Hello  Yes  Yes, they are. (listening; his expression changing) Done.
DOC => Pay attention, Sandman. I'm proud of this machine.
DOC => With this one there's no waiting for scar burnishing. It's all in one...watch now...
DOC => But here's the improvement. Instant healing---before you feel a thing. Watch now...
DOC => Perfect depth adjustment on this one, Sandman. The beam will cut through that uniform and just exactly through the skin beneath-- absolute precision. Watch now
DOC => Of course, it doesn't mend uniforms, Sandman, but otherwise it does everything, doesn't it? Just imagine what would happen to you if the healing stopped functioning.
HOLLY => No! You're scrambling the table. He'll be cut to pieces, Doc.
DOC => Damn right! It was a trap. They know!
LOGAN => No - I'm Running!
LOGAN => What I told you is the....
158- => 162XI     OUT
FRANCIS => What's going on, Logan?!
LOGAN => It has nothing to do with you.
FRANCIS =>  What are you talking about?! I saw you let a Runner go?  I saw you, Logan?? Tell me!!
JESSICA => Follow me, Logan. Stay close.
168- => 173         OUT
WANTON => I have an empty one, Sandman
177- => 179        SERIES OF SHOTS
186- => 186X1     OUT
LOGAN => Are you taking me to them?
JESSICA => Yes.  I don't know what else to do -- with him following us.  Why do you keep running from your--
LOGAN => Because he's my friend -  and I don't want to be killed by him - or anyone.
JESSICA => He's good, isn't he?
LOGAN => Will he find us and kill us? Yes...or one of the others.  You know there's only one place to go now...
JESSICA => They won't believe us.
LOGAN =>  I'd rather take my chances with them...than with Francis.
JESSICA => They wont listen.
LOGAN => You think Sandmen will?  There's no other way for me,
JESSICA => We'll convince them.
JESSICA => Yes, Logan.  I'm glad they didn't change your face.
JESSICA => Exactly four steps now. Let me lead you.  Now to the right. It's narrow here, you'll have to get behind me.
LOGAN => How will they know we're coming?
JESSICA => They're watching us now. They'll let us in when they're sure.
VOICE (scratchy, => filtered) Sandman, put your hands on your head.  Clasp your fingers together. Now turn your hands over. Palms up.  In a moment a light will shine in your eyes. Walk into it--Jessica first, then you, Sandman. You will have to stoop--but don't unclasp your hands. Do you agree?
VOICE => Hold still, Sandman, or die where you are.
2ND VOICE => Is she the one?
stage whispers) => She betrayed us. Kill him. Kill them both. Jessica you sold us. Sandman butcher. Sandman murderer.
LOGAN => I'm a runner. She brought me here because I begged her to help me.
VOICE => He's lying. No Sandman ever ran.
2ND VOICE => You don't run. You kill runners. You have killed runners all your life.    -
LOGAN => Yes I have.  Now it's my turn. And I want to live.
JESSICA => What's the matter with you. He's a runner-- he's blinking. We must help anyone who asks...we must-or we're the same as they are--deciding who lives and dies.
HOLLY => Holly. Holly, New You 483... He's dead. Doc's dead and the Sandmen came...
VOICE => Holly--Holly. Remember the code. The code, please Holly...
HOLLY => They smashed everything and I barely got away.  Holly. Station 12, Sanctuary 7. Holly. Holly...
HOLLY => It's him! The first Sandman. He killed...Doc.
JESSICA => No, Holly--wait! He's running. Tell them the rest!
HOLLY (suddenly => exhausted) He's the one. You too. I remember. He was in a hurry. Just a face job. Dark hair, I said. Then he killed Doc and you grabbed me--and the machine blew up and I ran...I ran
JESSICA => Holly. Holly! Please...The other Sandman. Remember the one who came after--
HOLLY (pouring => it out) That's right. The other one came after. The older one. Smashing, killing, burning!
JESSICA (coaching => desperately) ...and he was hunting the first one, this one. Wasn't he? Wasn't he? This one was running, the other one was hunting him...
HOLLY => Yes. Oh yes.  He was after you. I remember. You're running!
LOGAN => May we move?
VOICE => I saw we pass them through. Somebody help Holly.
VOICE => You two. Just go straight ahead. Follow the corridors with the pipes overhead to the end. Then use the key.
LOGAN => I don't know who you are. I'd like to thank someone.
VOICE => It doesn't matter who we are. Follow the tunnel to the end.
LOGAN => I Will there be someone to tell us where to go from there...?
VOICE => Someone will follow. When you come to the lock, he will tell you how Co go on the other side. Jessica may go with you as far as the lock.
LOGAN =>  No. Jessica goes back now. Take her back. (suddenly his tone is urgent as he speaks to her) Now! Go on back. Back outside, Jessica.
JESSICA => Why?- No...no...I'm going with you.
VOICE1 => Only to the lock. After that there's no way back.
JESSICA => I don't care. I'm going to Sanctuary. With you.
JESSICA => Will you take me with you?
LOGAN => Why, Jessica? You're still a green.
LOGAN => Come on then--they'll be here any minute!
FRANCIS =>  Logan. I know you're in here. What've you done...gone crazy over a Runner?  Nobody knows except me. You know I won't say anything. I should have turned you in but I couldn't. Leave her. Come on out with me. It'll look like you're part of the group that hit this nest.  Logan...you're a Sandman!  Logan...now...now...Logan...
VOICE => Runner, this is the last gate. Use your key now. When the Bell sounds again...use your key. Good luck, Runner. May you find Sanctuary.
JESSICA => Every key only works once...and only a Lastday key must open this door.... They said it would fit - but....
LOGAN => Wait - I have the one I took from the Runner.
JESSICA => There's no turning back, is there?
JESSICA => How do we know this is the right way?
LOGAN => It's the only way.
JESSICA => What do you suppose this was...?
LOGAN => Some kind of breeding pens...I suppose...They say people used to breed animal s, fish, anything  To eat, of course.
JESSICA => Ycch.  To kill things and then eat them. It must have been a savage world.
LOGAN => Stay here, while I see what it is.
JESSICA => It's Francis, isn't it?
FRANCIS (distorted; => echo; etcetera) LOGAN N N N.
JESSICA => I'm afraid.
LOGAN => It's brighter there...besides, we can't go back.
JESSICA => Wait.
JESSICA => I don't know what's going to happen to us Logan but --  Are you glad you didn't kill him?
LOGAN => It doesn't make any difference anymore.
JESSICA => You're really one of us now, aren't you?
LOGAN => You knew that I wasn't before, didn't you?  Why did you stay with me?
JESSICA => I wanted to... (Logan puts his arms around her) ...And you...what made you kill Sandmen?
LOGAN => I had to. I did kill...for the first time in my life I killed.
JESSICA => Because you felt like a Runner, didn't you.
LOGAN => I guess so...I know I felt something I never felt before...and I didn't like it...not a bit.  I'll tell you one thing...Sanctuary better be worth it. That's the last place for me to live now.
JESSICA => For us.
VOICE => Overwhelming, isn't it?
BOX => Are you too startled? Am I too removed from your ken?  I'm neither machine nor man...but a perfect fusion of the two...and better than either.  No human sculptor could match this greatness...don't you agree?
LOGAN => All right - what are you?
BOX => Your turn.
JESSICA => It's incredibly beautiful.
BOX => Ah, but wait for the winds. Then my birds sing. My walrus breathes. My palace chimes and bells. And the deep grottoes whisper my name...Box Box...Bahhhhxxxxsss...
LOGAN => We're hungry    do you have anything to eat?
BOX => Anything to eat?
JESSICA => We're human and we're hungry.
BOX => I know...I know.
LOGAN => This place is a link to Sanctuary, isn't it?
LOGAN => How do you think we got here??!!
BOX => You walked in. I saw you. Don't you remember?
LOGAN (beginning => again; quietly) Where do you think we came from?
BOX => From? From? From?
LOGAN => We were sent here and you know it. Others have been sent here. Where are they? Hiding?
BOX => Hiding? Yes! Hiding, hiding.
LOGAN => Where do we go?!  Where do we go from here??!!
BOX => Is that the wind?  Not yet...  You must hear my birds sing.
LOGAN => You know about Sanctuary! I know you do! You have to help us! You don't have a choice! It isn't your decision!! Tell us.
BOX => Never a pair. I have never had a pair.
LOGAN => Where do you send them?
BOX => You're a beautiful pair.
JESSICA => Please.
BOX => I've never seen humans whom I thought worthy of being here...  I'd like to sculpt you.  Where would I put you?  I know...you'd be the base of the column. You'd hold up my world!
LOGAN => Answer the question!
BOX => Do you know how long all this will last? Not thirty years...or thirty thousand years...but thirty thousand thousand years...and you'll be part of it. Ages will roll...Ages. And you'll be here...the two of you... eternally frozen...frozen...beautiful.
LOGAN => There must be somebody else up here. I can't believe that he's--
BOX (interrupting; => his voice tone changing; very lucid) Let me sculpt you and I will show you where the others have gone.
LOGAN => That's better.  How do you want us?
BOX => Nude. Imagine, a pair.
BOX => Up there.
LOGAN => How do you want us?
BOX => Up there.
BOX => Enchanting. Is that what humans do?
BOX => Superb!
BOX => Done...behold...!
BOX => Done...Done...Done...
JESSICA (squeezing => Logan's hand) It's glorious
LOGAN => All right. Now you keep your bargain.
LOGAN => How did they get in here?
BOX => Regular storage procedure...the same as the other food... The other food stopped coming and they started.
LOGAN => What other food?
BOX => Fish and plankton, sea greens and protein from the sea. (pointing to the frosted ice wall) It's all here - ready - fresh as harvest day. Fish and plankton, sea greens and protein from the sea...And then it stopped coming and they  came instead. So I store them here. I'm ready. And you're ready. It's my Job - protein, plankton, grass from the sea
LOGAN => Tell us how to get out...or Ill destroy you..I'll kill you!
BOX => Such a beautiful pair. I'll stand you facing one another.
BOX => Resign yourself.
BOX => I make such a small, quick incision ... you can hardly feel it.
BOX => All my work!' All my work!!
JESSICA => Is there something on fire!!
LOGAN => It seems to be moving away. Come on...
JESSICA => What's that?
LOGAN => It feels like breath. It makes everything move. Your hair is moving.
JESSICA => And yours.
LOGAN => Jessica -- we must be outside!
277-287X1 => OUT
JESSICA => I hate outside! I hate it!
288XA1    FRANCIS => Coming out through the fissure in the rock, squinting at the unexpected light from the sky, then setting out as Logan and Jessica did.
JESSICA => Don't!
LOGAN => Sooner or later, we'll have to try something
LOGAN => They're good.
JESSICA => It's getting dark and cold. I'm tired.
LOGAN => Why don't we rest here? We know we can eat these.
JESSICA => Where do you think that heat-ball went?
JESSICA => Do you think everything's going to turn to ice?
LOGAN => I doubt it.
JESSICA => Don't ever let go.
LOGAN => I won't.
LOGAN => It all seemed to make sense until Box.
JESSICA => Do you think he was telling the Truth?
LOGAN => How would anyone know? Even if we find it -- we can never go back.
LOGAN => You're right...it must be near now. We'll find it.
JESSICA (yawning; => closing her eyes; resting on his shoulder) Thirty thousand years didn't last very long, did they?
288X6- => 288X8    TRACKING SHOTS WITH LOGAN AND JESSICA
JESSICA => Logan!!!Look!!  No...your palm...look!!!
JESSICA => What does it mean?
JESSICA => You can have any woman in the city. What do you really want?
LOGAN => You know, Jessica.
JESSICA. => ...But I still have the choice...?
LOGAN => Of course.
JESSICA => Then the answer's Yes...
LOGAN => I have never seen a face like that before. It must be the look of great age. Whoever he was he was terribly old.
JESSICA => Yes, do you think that's why he looks so sad---?
LOGAN => They all have names and numbers on them. I wonder what they are?
JESSICA => "Beloved Husband". "Beloved Wife". What can all that mean?
JESSICA => Francis?
JESSICA (frowning; => whispering) Look at his face...and his hair...  Is that what it is to grow old?
LOGAN => It could be...
LOGAN => How old are you?
MAN => As old as I am I suppose...who knows ?
LOGAN => Your hair is white.
MAN => It wasn't always. I remember when it wasn't. But it wasn't your color either.  ...or yours. I have my color somewhere.
JESSICA => Those cracks in your face...do they hurt?
MAN => Oh, no...
JESSICA => Could I touch them?
MAN => Oh, my...please try.
JESSICA => What's your name?
MAN => I've forgotten. It's been so long since I've used it.
MAN => But all of my cats have names.
LOGAN => Is that what they're called-- cats?
OLD MAN => Yes, cats, of course. What else could they be? Cats. Of course each one has his own name too.
JESSICA => But there are so many of them. Do you know each one separately.
OLD MAN => Yes indeed, everyone. Actually, they all have three.  "The naming of cats is a difficult matter. It isn't just one of your holiday games. You may think at first I'm mad as a hatter when I tell you a cat must have THREE DIFFERENT NAMES."  An ordinary name and a fancy name. That's two. Do you want to guess what the third one is?
OLD MAN => "But above and beyond there's still one name left over, And that is the name that you never will guess; The name that no human research can discover -- - But THE CAT HIMSELF KNOWS, and will never confess." (reaching down and stroking another cat) Will you, my pet?
OLD MAN => "Why did you go little fourpaws? You forgot to shut your big eyes." (the man closes his eyes for a moment; then:) "I have a Gumble Cat in mind!"
LOGAN => How long have you been living here?
OLD MAN => For as long as I can remember.
LOGAN => What kind of place is this?
OLD MAN => Just a place, I suppose...who knows?
LOGAN => How did you get here?
OLD MAN => I have always been here...
LOGAN => Are there any other humans?
OLD MAN => Gracious...no.
LOGAN => Have any other people ever passed through?
OLD MAN => But there may be a few around somewhere.
LOGAN => What makes you think so?
OLD MAN => My parents thought so. Mother and Father. You know?
LOGAN => Mother and -- ? You knew your mother and father?
JESSICA => And...and how were you grown? Inside your mother?
OLD MAN => Yes...
JESSICA => Are you sure?
OLD MAN => Mother and Father said so... you know?
LOGAN => Where are they?
OLD MAN => Dead...they're dead...and buried.
OLD MAN => May I see your hand again?
OLD MAN => They're beautiful. May I have one too please?
LOGAN => No--I'm sorry. It's not possible.
OLD MAN => It isn't fair. I'll give you one of my favorite cats...a Jellicle cat.  "Jellicle cats have cheerful faces, Jellicle cats have bright black eyes; They like to practice their airs and graces And wait for the Jellicle Moon to rise."
LOGAN => I'm sorry but I don't have anything to give you.
JESSICA (simply; => sincerely) That's the truth.
JESSICA => Here you can have this.
OLD MAN => What kind of jewel is this?
JESSICA => I don't know.
OLD MAN => You're both full of secrets like Macavity.  Did you steal this?
JESSICA => No.
OLD MAN =>  "Macavity, Macavity, there's no one like Macavity, There never was a cat of such deceitfulness and suavity."
LOGAN => What's beyond this place - do you know?
OLD MAN => No, no, no
LOGAN => Did your Mother or Father ever mention another place?
OLD MAN => Never, never, ever. Nothing.
LOGAN => May we stay here for a while? We'd like to rest.
OLD MAN => Of course you can stay. This belongs to the people.
JESSICA => What belongs to the people?
OLD MAN => All this. All of it.
JESSICA => What people?
OLD MAN => I don't know...but it does.
OLD MAN => I'll be right back.  Oh, yes...about the cats... one rule is true:  "Don't speak till you are spoken to."
JESSICA => How curious people used to be -- All these books...
LOGAN => That sweet madman -- how could he Come to exist?
JESSICA => He had a mother and father -- and he knew them.
LOGAN => One in a million, I suppose
smiling) => ...Who knows?
JESSICA => We're going on, aren't we?
LOGAN =>  There's nothing to go on to, Jessica.
JESSICA => There's a Sanctuary...there is!
LOGAN => You want there to be one...that Doesn't...
JESSICA (interrupting; => urgent tone) There has to be! I know it exists! It has to!!
LOGAN => No, there doesn't. Not really --just so many want it to exist...so many who don't want to die...want it so much that a place called Sanctuary becomes "real". But it doesn't exist. It never existed. Just the hope.
JESSICA (becoming => hysterical) You're wrong!! It has to be!! It Just has to be!!
OLD MAN => Oh, my don't cry.
OLD MAN => There are larger pictures of other people over there. I don't know who they are. Perhaps they're family.
LOGAN => That's the same fellow who's outside. If he was so important - why isn't he first?
FRANCIS => What did you do to him?
FRANCIS => Why? Why you?  Do you know you ruined him? Do you know that? Can you tell me why? Why you?  And now you've killed him, you know...
JESSICA => Logan!!!
FRANCIS => Here!!!!
OLD MAN => How nice...more company...
FRANCIS (emotional; => disjointed thoughts) We had such good times together... I let you go!  You didn't terminate a Runner and I let you go!!  She did this to us! How could you let her?! An ordinary available??!! (with this he flings Jessica down and away. She lies there...stunned) And what about Logan-6 and Francis-8?  ....Why didn't you chink about them?!  There's over two hundred years of Sandmen's blood in you, Logan.... and now you'll spill it for a stinking Runner!!
LOGAN => Look at your palm, Francis.... look! It's clear. Clear!
FRANCIS => Why did you do that??!!
LOGAN => I didn't do anything, Francis! They've made us believe that....
FRANCIS (interrupting; => wild) Why did you do that???!!!
FRANCIS => That was the right shot--Look out there, he's trying to break free Watch it, Logan, steady, now!......
FRANCIS => Logan! You renewed!
OLD MAN => Oh, my...he died...
OLD MAN => Well have to bury him.
JESSICA => Whats that?
OLD MAN => Theyre put into the ground so they can be visited by the living...
OLD MAN => Ill make the arrangements.
JESSICA => At least its over...
OLD MAN => Are you ready to put him in?
LOGAN => Not yet.
OLD MAN => All right.
OLD MAN => "Vigil wondrous and vigil sweet there in the fragrant silent night."
OLD MAN => Of course...that's settled then. But just you remember your promise...
JESSICA => We'll remember. But that's a long time off...
LOGAN => What are we promising him? What can we possibly give him?
JESSICA => He asked if we would bury him when his time comes.
LOGAN => We can't. We're going back.
JESSICA => To what?
LOGAN => I'm going to try and tell people what we've seen and--
JESSICA => You're lying! You'll never have the chance to tell anybody anything! You'll be killed the moment you're seen!
LOGAN => Do you expect me to let things go on without trying to change them?!
JESSICA => Things won't change...you know that! We can live here together, Logan... have a life as long as his... together!
LOGAN => Things change!
JESSICA => You want to go back to kill, is that it?! Now, you'll want to kill your own!!! kill Sandmen!!! Killing's all you ever...!!!!
LOGAN => Jessica...listen to me...listen to me...  The Lifeclocks made me kill Francis. They make people die or be killed every day. If I didn't try and destroy that...I couldn't live here or anywhere. Do you understand?
JESSICA => I want to be alive and with you, that's all I want.
LOGAN => I know...I know...
LOGAN => We're leaving.
OLD MAN => What a pity. I was hoping you'd be here to bury me.
JESSICA => Come with us.
OLD MAN => Where are you going?
LOGAN => To a city with thousands and thousands of people.
OLD MAN => Alive?
OLD MAN => Thousands and thousands...as many as my cats?
LOGAN => More...many more.
OLD MAN => And all alive you say?
OLD MAN => Yes, I would like to see that. Is it a long journey?
OLD MAN => Thousands and thousands alive... oh, my...
OLD MAN => Never see the sun or the moon... I hope we get there soon...
LOGAN => I promise. We '11 go on as soon as it's light.
JESSICA (gently, => turning O.M. away) But now I'm tired. Let's go back to the fire...
OLD MAN => That's better than gold when it's cold.
LOGAN => Thank you.  Tell me - what do those words mean? "Beloved husband...Beloved son"... "Beloved wife"'...
OLD MAN => My father was the husband and my mother was the wife. "Beloved" is a word they used - to stay together.
LOGAN => Stay? They lived together all their years?
OLD MAN => Oh, yes...I think...
JESSICA (reading; => moved) Beloved son...  So people stayed together for that feeling of love... They would live and raise children together and be remembered.  I think I feel that way, Logan. Can we be that way?
LOGAN => Yes. You and I, Jessica. 
JESSICA => And Sanctuary?
LOGAN => Sanctuary is the right to live.... nothing more. But nothing less, either....
JESSICA => Beloved husband...
LOGAN => Beloved wife...
JESSICA => What does that water do?
LOGAN => It's part of the hydrogalvanic system. The ocean tides are changed into energy somehow.
JESSICA => Is it inside the city?
LOGAN => Of course.  I don't know where...  I Just took them for granted.  It's our only chance.
LOGAN => I know... (after a beat; to the Old Man) We're going to try and get in this way. I don't think you can make it.
OLD MAN => Oh...I did so look forward to seeing all those people.
LOGAN => I'm sorry.
OLD MAN => Yes...
LOGAN => Can you make it back?
OLD MAN => Oh my...I'll try.
JESSICA => Goodbye.
OLD MAN => Oh, my...
369- => 369Xl     OUT
LOGAN => No!! Don't go in there !!
LOGAN => You don't have to die!! No one has to die at thirty!!! You don't have to blink out on Lastday. There's no renewal on Carrousel! You can live longer and grow old... I've seen it. She's seen it!! Believe me!!
