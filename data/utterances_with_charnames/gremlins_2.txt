CLAMP => Good morning, Mister Wing. Let's out through to key issues, okay? I'm prepared to increase my offer substantially.
CLAMP => Take a look, Mister Wing --
GIZMO => Tee vee!
CLAMP => Now,'we've been able to reach an understanding with everyone on the block -- except for you. Let me show you what I willing to do for you -- a s tand and souvenir cone on, right here under the at The foot traffic thrr here is going to make the building look like a ghost town.
CLAMP => Please IF us know when you've made a decision, Mister Wing. You know, I believe that there's always an area of agreement that two people can reach. The Clamp Corporation's LOGO a stylized "C" -- fills the wereen, replacing Clamp's image.
MR. WING => Yes -- a man can always agree with others. It is more difficult to agree with oneself.
FORSTER => Does that mean you -- He's interrupted as Mr. Wing COUGHS -- a rattling spasm that sounds deeply unhealthy. When the coughing subsides, he answers Forster.
MR. WING => I'm sorry. Please tell Mister Clamp that the answer is no.
FORSTER => Keep the TV. As Mr. Wing walks Clamp's men to the door in b.g., HOLD on the TV set -- and a small, furry PAW that reaches into FRAME to change the TV CHANNEL. With the change of stations, the TV screen fills with a SCENE from a Rambo picture. SYLVESTER STALLONE addresses the movie
STALLONE => To survive a war... you've got to become war. Then he screws an explosive-filled metal ARROWHEAD onto an arrow, and SHOOTS the arrow from a bow. The arrow hits a HELICOPTER, which bursts into FLAMES.
GIZMO => Neat!
MR. WING => Television again! Ai-vuh !. An - invention for fools.
CD => As he starts COUGHING again,
BODYGUARD => I'm sorry that didn't work out, sir. I thought he'd like the TV.
FORSTER => You hear that cough? The guy must be eighty -- maybe ninety. We can wait.
REPORTER => Mister Wing' ath removes the last obstacl eveloper Daniel Clamp's long- ehinatown project...
PRODUCER => "is Then we go to the boss -- The video IMAGE SWITCHES to Clamp being interviewed behind his spotless, high-tech desk.
CLAMP => .obviously a sad occasion, but the bright side is that we can go ahead with something that will mean a great deal to the community down there...
REPORTER => That old guy had some neat stuff in his store. You think they'll auction it off, or...?
PRODUCER => Nash...I hear they're just gonna tear it down.
GRANDMASTER FLASH => It's like a jungle sometimes, It makes me wonder How I keep from going under...
KATE => I should be finished by six tonight. If we go straight from work, we can make the Early Bird Special at the movies.
BILLY => It's going to be close. Maybe we could do it tomorrow -- no, tomorrow's when the Futtermans are
KATE => Mister Futterman must be getting better, if he can travel.
BILLY => His wife says he's getting better. He's just been -- rattled.
KATE => I guess having a bunch of monsters drive a snow plow through jour living room could kind of that to you. He almost got kied.
BILLY => Right. (checks his watc4LI We're gonna be late,
TAXI DRIVER => You goin' a' the airport?
BILLY => No, the -- The taxi ROARS away -- Billy lets go of the door handle just in time.
KATE => Billy...I don't think we're getting the hang of New York.
13A => FOLLOW Billy and Kate as they approach the Clamp office building, where we saw guys editing videotape earlier.
BILLY => I'll try and get out early tonight. I have to finish that drawing of the Chinatown building...  You know, I -had the whole thing just right they're making we take twent p ies off the World Trade Center ofjbVilding looks bigger. Z? F
KATE => A lot of people aren't as thered by that kind of thing as you are, Billy.
BILLY => Yeah, no kidding...I don't think I'm getting that promotion this year.
KATE => That's okay. We don't have to wait.
BILLY => Yeah we do. It wouldn't feel right, getting married on the money I'm making now. It's bad enough that you got me the job --
KATE => I didn't get you the job, I just heard about it. Billy, you can get promoted and stuff if you want to, but you have to act like you deserve it. Let people know you're there.
BILLY => Want to try the revolving doors today? Before Kate can answer, a WORKER enters one of the revolving doors. The power-assisted door, going too fast, WHOOSHES him inside, and we HEAR --
WORKER => Aagghhh!
KATE => Uh-uh. They use a regular door instead.
DOREEN => .hope you've enjoyed your tour of the world's most modern automated office building. Don't forget, copies of Mr. Clamp's best-selling book, I Took Manhattan, are on sale at the newsstand...
KATE => Don't let things get to you.
BILLY => I Won't.
VOICE => Thank you for pushing the button. The elevator will be here soon. Nearby, CAMERA picks up Daniel Clamp's lieutenant Forster. As Forster walks hurriedly through the lobby, his belt pager
BEEPS. => At the sound, Forster changes course, heading for an ALCOVE offer the lobby, where he unlks_ a cabinet and opens it ' -"eveal it big TV SCREEN with Clamp's impatient face on it, and a i&e _ CAMERA on top.
CLAMP => Forster, I've got the planning commission people coming in here today. Those condos I want to build, on top of the Chrysler building? We'rea a close to an okay.
FOR => Yes sir.
J => So I wan A is place running like a clock the systems, the people, verything.
FORSTER => Yes sir. I'm doing a decor compliance check this morning. Tonight I'm doing a random drug search, and -- He's interrupted as an aging MAN IN A DRACULA COSTUME (GRANDPA FRED) comes over to the cabinet and tries to address Clamp over the TV hookup.
GRANDPA FRED => Excuse me. Mister Clamp, could I speak with you for a --
FORSTER => We're busy.
GRANDPA FRED => I just need a -- Forster snaps the cabinet shut.
FORSTER => I said -- we're busy.
MARLA => Billy --
BILLY => Hi, Marla, how --
MARLA => Your Chinatown drawing. We have to have it. It's a crisis panic emergency. The printers are killing us --
BILLY => Yeah, I just have to -- They get on the elevator, with other WORKERS. The doors close.
ELEVATOR VOO => Please state your desired floor number.
MARLA WORKER => I've got thirty- (to two people ' elevator) screaming at me for -- Sixt--
ELEVATOR VOICE => Your request is floor thirty-two. Digital NUMBERS flash past on the elevator's display.
WORKER =>  No, no, not thirty--
BILLY =>  Don't -- But it's too late.
ELEVATOR VOICE => You have cancelled floor thirty-two. The elevator violently STOPS SHORT, tossing everybody around.
ELEVATOR VOICE => Please state your new desired floor number.
MARLA => 0 Sixteen.  I hate this thing. The elevator stops at their floor, and the doors open. Billy follows Marla out into The advertising department of Daniel Clamp's empire occupies modern, "open-plan" offices -- endless beige partitions form tiny CUBICLES full of "ergonomic" furniture. Unseen speakers pipe in "WHITE NOISE" -- low-volume static to insulate conversations.
MARLA => Listen, this deadline. Its not my fault. They're making me miserable so I have to make you miserable. It's a complete heart attack disaster horgor story. As Billy and Marla walk, t ass a WORKER who's -t4ing to get a drink from the d ar ygr WATER_ When he pushes the button, the f ain'ss ,got' VERSHOOTS by several inches, SPLASHING onto The worker contorts himself to get, a drink,,b is face SPLASHED when the fountain surges. Billy and Marla a4lie at Billy's cubicle, whose "work station" consists of a dra g board and several drawers. The PHONE is equipped with a VIDEO SCREEN. SPOT a small, struggling POTTED PLANT, and, pinned to the cubicle wall, Billy's DRAWING of the main street of Kingston Falls. On Billy's drawing board is an illustration of Clamp's projected Chinatown building -- _a l s monstrosity with insane pagoda touches. But Billy has tried to breathe some' 3 e into it, wit r T the street, kids flying dragon kites, etc. Marla looks over Billy's shoulder at the drawing.
BILLY => It's almost finished. I just have to make some --
MARLA => That courtyard looks cold. That'd be nicer with the trees.
BILLY => Are they going to plant trees 40 there?
I1A. => 18 CX INu : 18
0 MARLA => No, but you're going to draw them.
BILLY => But, Maria ----
MARLA => Elms.
BILLY => Right. He's about to sit down to work, when Daniel Clamp's lieutenant Forster and his clipboard-carrying ASSISTANT come down the row of cubicles, looking around.
MARLA => Hi, Mister Forster. Forster nods at Marla, runs an eye over Billy's cubicle.
FORSTER => It looks like somebody hasn't( i employee manual...d ' 1 it, r As he speaks, Forster opens a therette folder and takes out a bar-code reading WAND attached to the folder by curly cable. He runs the wand over the bar-code on Billy's chest, and reads from an LCD display in the 0 folder.
FORSTER => -- Peltzer.
BILLY => Uh, what's --
FORSTER => Unauthorized potted plant -- possible aphid infestation. As Forster's assistant jots on his clipboard, Billy puts the plant in a desk drawer, and Forster spots Billy's drawing on his partition.
FORSTER => What ig this?
BILLY => My home town.
FORSTER => Mister Peltier, do you know how much the Clamp organization has spent to provide its employees with art by recognized artists at this facility?
FORSTER => Eye-resting. Color-coordinated. Authorized,
BILLY => Yes air. It was just a --
FORSTER => A little touch, yes. Maybe eyerybods here would like to do some little touches. Coffee mugs that say "World's Greatest Lover." The cute little hula doll they bought in Hawaii. The "Snoopy" comic that just says it JJ1. You'd like that, wouldn't qu, Mister Peltzer? d 1
Q) => i don t see any --
FORSTER => Coming to work every day in a Jy_Q hundred million dollar flea marks XZZ He turns to move on. 0
ASSISTANT => With a "z," right? As the assistant follows Forster away, Billy puts his drawing of Kingston Falls in a pocket. Marla stews.
MARLA => Billy, this is Just what I don't need right now. Do you realize we've got department review in three weeks? This is a nuclear meltdown disaster, I mean it.
BILLY => Sorry, Marla.
KATE => The Clamp Centre is the most advanced "smart building" in America, with the latest, in security, communications, and climate control. If you'll follow me over here... Still talking, she takes them toward a STAIRCASE.
KATE => The Clamp Centre is just one part of Mister Clamp's round-the-world business network, which includes construction, sports, finance, and a popular line of jams and jellies...and, of course, as those of you who have cable TV at home know, the Clamp Cable Network. CLOSE on a VIDEO IMAGE oft v With Marge show. MARGE 0 takes a dish from one of many ' r ovens on her set.
MARGE => .some people have written in to say that, if they're serving these dishes in a dark room, maybe for those romantic occasions, they notice a glow coming from some of the meat courses. Now, that's perfectly normal... REVEAL that this image is on a control-room monitor at the Clamp Cable studios. Billy, carrying a shopping bag, passes the control roomand turns down a narrow hallway.
GRANDPA FRED => .tonight's movie is so scary -- the people who saw it when it came out in the theaters twelve years ago are just learning how to speak simple phrases and eat solid food again! That's right'. Talk about scary' It's a good thing your Grandpa Fred is here with you -- He waits for something he expected to hear, but it doesn't happen. He breaks character.
GRANDPA FRED => Where's the moan?
DIRECTOR (0. => (on P.A. from boo The what?
GRANDPA FA => The moan. There's posed to be a moan, from t ck, and I say, "Oh, Renfield, y a o u want some more flies, don't you," and I go back there and open the door --
DIRECTOR => Oh. Sorry, Fred. Can somebody find the tape with the moan? Grandpa Fred sits down, disgusted. Billy goes over to him.
BILLY => Hi, Fred. Hey, I was sorry to hear about your new time slot. I think they're making a big mistake.
GRANDPA FRED => A mistake? Kid. it's a disaster. People that watch TV at three-thirty in the morning are not scared of the Wolfman. The only thing that scares those people is getting sober and finding work.
BILLY => Yeah. I brought you something.
GRANDPA FRED => Watch it with that thing. Billy puts the bat on top of a cobwebbed TV SET that's part of Grandpa Fred's set.
BILLY => I thought it would look good over here.
GRANDPA FRED => Frankly, kid, this was not what I had in mind. I went Into broadcasting, I wanted to do news. Public affairs. Something meaningful.
BILLY => Horror movies can be meaningful, Fred. You should run some of the classics -- Frankenstein, m a cula...
GRANDPA FRED => All the great horror movies are in black and white. Mister Clamp only likes color. I donky ven have a gimmick. No species effects. A puppet that c s out of a box -- whoopee.
DIRECTOR  O => We've got the moan, Fred. A listless, anemic MOAN is heard through the P.A.
GRANDPA FRED => That's the moan?
DIRECTOR => That's what we've got, Fred. And... rolling... Grandpa Fred gamely goes back into character.
GRANDPA FRED => Oh, Renfield, you want some --
BILLY => You should run some of the classics, Fred -- FFAnkenstein, Dracula ...
GRANDPA FRED => All the great horror movies are in black and white. Mister Clamp only likes color. That guy is str___._. ange.
BILLY => You've seen him?
GRANDPA FRED => Well, of in person, but -- just to this building. You know wha V t nd f tenants they have here? There' esearch laboratory upat t2 -- tenet,] c research. Foolin d with animals, cutting thl .last
3 F => week, they took out a patent on a new kind of gerbil. People think Ia creepy.
BILLY => Well -- I wanted to get away from Kingston Falls. I guess I did.
GRANDPA FRED => You. got that right, kid. Have you heard these voices they have here now? Don't look at me like that. You know that white noise they play all the time? The static?
BILLY => Yeah. That's so they can put people close together and they won't overhear each other. You're not supposed to notice it.
GRANDPA FRED => Sure. But if you listen to it -- there are little voices in there.
GRAND FRED => That's what th Id's coming to, kid. You can't talk to yourself without ebody interrupting.
FORSTER => Let me hear the voices. The technician brings up VOICES on a speaker. They sound like voice-overs on slick TV commercials.
ANNOUNCERS' VOICES => (dynamic many .I'm an honest kind of guy -- and not stealing office supplies works for me, and e way I live today...
FORSTER => That's fine --
A TECHNICIAN => to Forster) It's for you, sir. Forster turns to see a technician pointing at a MONITOR showing CLAMP'S FACE. Forster greets the screen.
FORSTER => Yes, Mister Clamp.
CLAMP => I'm going to a meeting about the Vermont thing. It looks like that takeover is going to happen.
FORSTER => That's terrific, sir.
CLAMP => No kidding. How many guys do you know that have their own state? Did I show you that picture of the mountains?
FORSTER => Yes sir. Tall!
CLAMP => While I'm in there, get that revolving door fixed downstairs. It shorted out last night while I had some money people here. Mrs. Tanaka is still spinning.
FORSTER => I'll -- But a Camp LOGO ;ills the monitor screen, and Clamp's face disappe rs behipo- it. Forster turns and looks over a technician's shoulder at a MONITOR. A spy CAMERA shows a stressed-out EMPLOYEE lighting a cigarette in a STOREROOM.
TV) => 0 Forster punches button on the cinsole, picks up a microphone and talks into it:
FORSTER. 5NT.) => That's an unaut iz,pd break period, pal. a don't work here anymore. On the monitor, the startled employee looks around for the source of the voice.
FORSTER => We have a problem communicating here? You're gone. Clean out the desk. One hour. Thanks so much. He puts down the mike, and moves on to lczg..aatier`t4`S'"sioul"d?r p switch marked OXYGEN. '
FORSTER => What are you doing?
TECHNICIAN =>  There's not much air in the building, sir.
FORSTER => At four o'clock, people go into a slump. Then we give them oxygen,
TECHNICIAN => Yes air.
PEGGY 11.0 => Can I help you?
MESSENGER => Yeah, got a delivery here.. He follows her back to
MESSENGER => What kind of stuff do they do-ft there, anyway?
PEGGY => We're not supposed to talk about it.
MESSENGER => Huh. This is for Doctor Catheter.
PEGGY => I can sign for it.
MESSENGER => Okay. This copy's yours. Thanks. Whistling Gizmo's tune again, the messenger leaves the office -- almost running into DR. CATHETER, Splice-o-Life's chief scientist, who's on his way in.
PEGGY => Doctor Catheter, this just came for you.
DR. CATHETER =>  Oh, good. This might be my malaria...  No, this is just rabies. I have rabies. And I was supposed to get the flu this week.
PEGGY => I think the flu is on b;Eo -order. She takes out a Kleenex, blows he(;Z>nose again. Dr. Catheter holds his hand out. Q
DR. CATHETE => May I have that, Peg
PEGGY Q) => Oh, uh -- sure... Dr. Catheter takes the Kleenex, and heads for the inner office.
DR. CATHETER =>  Back order. All a man wants is some fresh germs... FOLLOW Catheter back to
DR. CATHETER => Hello, Wally. Your lights are flickering again.
WALLY => Are they? Dr. Catheter turns to a table where several different potted vegetable PLANTS are att ed to collecting tubes that feed into a central glass VIAL. DR. CAfTER How are we doing on a vegetable medley plant, Wally talked to the Bird's-Eye peopl ain. They're very excited . Wally nods, sighing -- the long-sgff ring researcher.
WALLY => We came close yesterday, Doctor. But it rejected the pimento.
DR. CATHETER => You'll get it, Wally.
WALLY => I'm very pleased about this bat project, though... He leads Catheter toward a group of ANIMAL CAGES,
WALLY => You know, in some parts of the world, there are millions of bats. They could make terrific messengers, like pigeons...
DR. CATHETER => Yes, but they only come out at night.
WALLY => That's what we're working on, sir. They arrive at a cage where a resting BAT hangs upside down. An intravenous TUBE, sticking out of the bat's flesh, is connected to a drip bottle whose label bears a shining SUN logo.
WALLY => This is a formula of vitamins,
DR. CATHETER => Very nice. Catheter draws closer to Wally, and speaks with creepy
WALLY => Oh, uh -- that's fferent bat, Doctor. South Amen.
SCIENTIST => 0 Wally, could you let me have some growth hormone? I'm a little short. FOLLOW Catheter to another side of the lab, where two more SCIENTISTS are at work. One of them  greets Catheter, while the other  has his back to us at the moment.
DR. CATHETER => Hello, Lewis.
LEWIS => Hi, Doctor.
DR. CATHETER => How's that cloning work coming? Martin turns around. He is Lewis's IDENTICAL TWIN.
MARTIN => R R e l_ well, Doctor. The twins talk in rapid e nation, as if they share a brain. LEWIS t A Say, Doctor, look at
MARTIN => .I think you'll find it interesting. Following the SOUND of the crooning that caught the messenger's attention, they take Catheter over to a lab table where the LIGHTS ARE LOWERED above a covered cage. Martin pulls back the cloth to reveal GIZMO, who stops singing and looks up at them.
LEWIS => Some sort of rodent, apparently...
MARTIN => .and it can't take bright light.
LEWIS => Watch this, Doctor. He opens the side door of Gizmo's cage and turns on a TAPE PLAYER. Hearing the bouncy ROCK MUSIC, Gizmo playfully DANCES out of the cage as the scientists talk.
DR. CATHETER => Hmp! Qu-te, isn't he?
MARTIN => That may be genetic...
LEWIS => .we're not sure yet. But as he amuses his captors, Gizmo is slyly looking around for a way out of here. He edges farther away from the cage...
DR. CATHETER => Not so fast, pal. He abruptly switches the MUSIC off, and GRABS Gizmo just before the Mogwai can make good his escape. Dr. Catheter sticks the frightened Gizmo back in the cage, and shuts the side door firmly.
DR. CATHETER => What's wrong with you two? He almost made a break for it.
MARTIN => Sorry, sir
DR. CATHETER => How are you going to pro, with him? (vim
LEWIS 113 => Cell samples tomorr
MARTIN => .tissue culture hursday.
DR. CATHETER => And then there's body structure. And for that, my little friend... The three scientists LOOM over the terrified Gizmo. Dr. Catheter reaches into the cage to give Gizmo a POKE.
DR. CATHETER => .we'll just have to cut you.
BILLY => Hell. The WORKER in the next cubicle speaks up.
CUBICLE NEIGHBOR => Jump around.
BILLY => What?
CUBICLE NEIGHBOR => You sat still for too long. The building thinks you left. It's saving energy. Jump around. Billy jumps around, and the LIGHTS come back on, as the messenger who visited the genetics lab comes to the Cubicle Neighbor's desk with a package.
MESSENGER => Package for you.
CUBICLE NEIGHBOR => Oh. Thanks. But as the Cubicle Neighbor signs the(P erwork, the messenger whistles to himself -- Gizmo's song min, in that sad minor. For a moment, Billy doesn't regis t -- and then CAMERA catches the realization dawningQ s face, as he looks over the cubicle partition and asks ijr'lntly:
BILLY => Where did you heaA-11; at?
MESSENGER => Huh?
BILLY => That music. Where did you hear it?
MESSENGER => Oh, uh --
BILLY => No. It's not by Sting. Think. Where did you --
MESSENGER => Oh, hey -- I know. I was up in that laboratory, you know, on eighteen, and somebody was, like, humming it --
BILLY => Did you see who it was?
MESSENGER => Nuh-uh, it was in the back -- Billy takes off.
BILLY => How you doin'? I bear your copier's down.
PEGGY => Oh. Hi. It's back in ther4.
MARTIN => This is the most interesting bio- electrical work I've ever been involved in. Here you go, boy... He FEEDS the rat some liquid from a VIAL with a LIGHTNING-BOLT insignia on its label.
LEWIS => Think of it...millions of rats in New York, and everyone hates them...
MARTIN => But if one of them could power a portable radio for a month... He throws the switch. The rat's eyes WIDEN, then calm down as the current goes off. Dr. Catheter touches the rat, and quickly pulls his hand back from the electric SHOCK.
DR. CATHETER => Definite progress, fellows. if we could just make it safe to touch them...
LEWIS => Theodore! What are you doing out?
MARTIN => Alvin! Put down that DNA! As the scientists chase the monkeys, Billy hurries to Gizmo's cage. He opens the cage, and HIS EYES MEET GIZMO'S -- it's hard to say which of then is more excited. But the gala reunion will have to wait. Billy scoops Gizmo into his toolbox. He walks out of the lab, leaving the copier a mess.
32 32 => Billy goes through a small anteroom and a second door, into the bathroom, where he leans against the door, catching his breath. He starts to lift the cover on the cage, then remembers to turn the LIGHTS down. He lifts the cover -- A boy and his Mogwai! EMOTIONS flood over their faces -- recognition, relief, shared secrets and memories. Billy props the cage on a sink, takes Gizmo out.
BILLY => Hey, guy...did you miss me? Gizmo does EYE MOVEMENTS -- shyly hedging, then admitting it.
BILLY => Yeah, me too. Let's put you up here. We don't want to get any water on you.
GIZMO => 
s doing => Gizmo shrinks back, terrified.
BILLY => That bad, huh? How did you get in there? What happened to Mister Wing? Gizmo looks sad -- indicates his armband.
BILLY => Oh. I'm sorry. But then -- He stops at a sudden SOUND -- VOICES in the anteroom between the bathroom and the hail.
BILLY => Quick -- get in here. He slips Gizmo into the tool box, above his protesting TWITTERS.
BILLY => Sshh -- just wait a minute --
FORSTER => You're wetting my shoes, Peltzer. Billy sees Forster, sees the shoes, grabs a paper towel and is about to drop to his knees.
BILLY => I'm sorry, sir -- let me --
FORSTER => Stand up, Peltzer. Come with me. Billy grabs the tool box and follows Forster out the door. As they go into the anteroom, Forster's clipboard-carrying ASSISTANT joins them. #
FORSTER => Do you know what that eans, Peltzer?
BILLY => It means "men's bathroom."
FORSTER => What is the man holding?
BILLY => In the bathroom?
FORSTER => On the sign, Peltzer.
BILLY => Oh. A little briefcase, sir.
FORSTER => That's right. Because this -- is the executive washroom. I don't think you belong in there, do you Peltzer?
BILLY => Oh. Well. My mistake --
BILLY =>  That's in there? Forster snaps the folder shut. Gizmo, restless, RATTLES the tool box.
FORSTER => What's in the box, Peltzer?
BILLY => Oh, uh -- art supplies.  I'm mixin ' nts. Well, I better get back t 1 here --
FORSTER => Hm. I think our "random" drug search later on should be very interesting.
ASSISTANT =>  Got it, sir.
BILLY => Gizmo, you've got to be quiet. You don't want to go back to that laboratory, do you?
GIZMO => (Muffled twitter of acquiescence.
E BILLY => We'll go home soon, and --
MARLA => Mister Clamp -- sir, I'm Marla Bloodstone, I'm the department head here, if there's anything I can --
CLAMP => That's okay. Everybody just relax, and go back to what you'd be doing normally. I know I haven't been down here before, but that's going to change. I'm going to be a little more "hands-on" with these operations from now on... As he speaks, Clamp glances over Billy's shoulder, and spots the Chinatown drawing.
BILLY => This?
CLAMP => You've captured the whole essence of the project here. Look at the kids with the kites. That's warmth. I like warmth. What's your name?
BILLY => Peltzer. Billy -- Bill Peltzer. Marla watches, saucer-eyed, as Clamp shakes hands with Billy.
CLAMP => That's what we need here. People who produce.  Let's lose these elm trees, though. People think "elm," they think "Dutch," "disease" -- Gizmo's drawer rattles open. Billy snaps it shut.
CLAMP => What's with that drawer?
BILLY => Oh, it's, uh -- it's automatic. It opens up now and then, in case you need anything.
CLAMP => Huh. I didn't know about that one. He moves on, nodding vaguely at Marla -- who goes over to Billy, looking at him through completely new eyes.
MARLA => Did you hear that? "People who produce. I've been working here six years, and I've never even seen him in person.
BILLY => Well -- he likes the drawing
MARLA => This is big, Billy. T i.s career opportunity,q4 cement window.For both
MARLA => Clearly. We can talk about it at dinner.
BILLY => Oh. That soundsgreat. I could do it, let's see...
MARLA => Tonight.
BILLY => No, I can't tonight. I've got -- an appointment.
MARLA => I've got something tonight too, Billy. A brochure for the Clamp Cable Archery Channel. It's a total suicide trauma red alert deadline situation. And you know what? I'm letting it go to have dinner with you.
E BILLY => I just don't think I can --
MARLA => What ,g with that drawer, Billy? I know every feature in this building. We don't have anything that opens itself.
BILLY => Oh -- I knocked against it with my leg, I was --
MARLA => Billy, are you keeping some kind of ppI in there? It's a good thing Mister Clamp likes you so much, because --
BILLY => A pet? No, no, I'm alle $,; MARLA ,\ \ l Let.me see. Come
BILLY => You know -- I think if we leave right now, I could go to dinner. Just a quick one --
MARLA => Great. There's this very chic new restaurant. It's Canadian. They clean the fish right at your table.
BILLY => Sounds terrific.
MARLA => Let me just grab my coat, and I'll be right back. As Marla goes O.S., Billy slips Gizmo's drawer open and talks into it.
BILLY => Gizmo...I have to go now. Just wait here, okay? Just stay put for a few minutes and -- He hurriedly closes the drawer as Marla approaches.
MARLA => Ready?
BILLY => Yeah. He grabs his sportcoat, and follows Maria toward the elevators. As they go, CAMERA HOLDS on Gizmo's drawer. It slowly shakes i open, and the curious Mogwai's eyes and ears come into view, i checking out the world of Billy's office. Gizmo ducks back out of sight ...but, a moment later, a CHAIN OF LARGE PAPER CLIPS is tossed down from the drawer, making a ladder to the floor. As Gizmo starts hoisting himself over the edge of the drawer,
BILLY => Uh -- could you excuse me a second? I'll be right back. Sure. Billy heads for an alcove at the
KATE => Hi! I'm almost ready --
BILLY => Iii.. Listen, Xate --
KATE => What's wrong?
BILLY => Nothing. Um, nothing's wrong, but I can't go out tonight. I have a --- meeting. With some people.
KATE => Oh, damn.
BILLY => I know. I'm sorry. But it's good E for -- what we were talking about, you know? Letting people know I'm there and everything?
KATE => In the middle of the night?
BILLY => Kate, I need you to do something for me. Gizmo's here.
KATE => What?
BILLY => It's a long story -- I'll explain it later. He's up in my desk drawer. You have to take him home.
KATE => Take him ham? Billy, this is nuts. If those things start running around in New York --
BILLY => There won't be any "thin ust remember the rules. H a ''.t take bright light -- a ec sunlight. It, 1 his. And you can't get wat him. And the most important thing -- never feed
KATE => Can't he Just -- go back where you found his?
BILLY => No. I have to go to this -- meeting. Please -- I'll be home as soon as I can, A beat.
BILLY => Great. Thanks. He gives her a quick kiss, and leaves the tour guides' office. Kate waits a moment, then looks out into the lobby... 44A INT. LOBBY - KATE'S POV 44A i .and sees Billy leaving the building with Marla.
DOE)( => Waco ! -- as Gizmo watches the ra,k n :,wa t basket TIP OVER. Looking into the basket, we  SE ` umble of office wastepaper, which is violently toss e ut... .until MOHAWK, the fourth new Mogwai, emerges. This guy is pure, malicious evil, a new strain of badness. Even as a furry Mogwai, he's about as cuddly as a cockroach. While Daffy, up on the desktop, starts playing with everything in sight... .Mohawk, on the floor, moves in on Gizmo.
GIZMO => Uh-oh. George and Lenny drop down to the carpet to join Mohawk, as Gizmo -- standing now -- backs away. There's a grated VENT opening low on the wall behind him. Lenny grabs Gizmo with a fast-moving paw, and Mohawk, moving in close, SPITS in Gizmo's eyes.
DAFFY => Wa-hogs !
FORSTER => Hah! Good boy! I knew we'd find something in this guy's desk -- -- but as they reach Billy's desk, they find Daffy's paint PAW PRINTS tracking crazily over every surface. The dog keeps going bananas, but it's not drugs he smells -- it's the dander of the recently departed Daffy.
FORSTER => Look at this mess! What kind of footprints are these?
GUARD => Hard to say, sir. A possible
FORSTER => He's bringing pets to work. I don't believe this guy-it's not just plants. He's got to have 1,_. e s t ock .
0 KATE => Gizmo, how'd you get up there?
KATE => Billy said to take you home. You'd better stay in my purse till we get out of the building.
4O. => 53B CONTINUEDi 53B She slips his into the purse, puts it over her shoulder. As gate heads for the exit, an ANGLE into her purse...
MARLA => Did you always know you were going to be an artist?
0 BILLY => Well -- I always liked to draw. When I was little, with my crayons, I would do these comic strips, and drawings of the teachers and stuff...
MARLA => I had crayons too, i y. And when I was four years old, I was using them to write dos to the other children. Even then, I knew. C_j
BILLY => Hub. That's somethin
MARLA => Isn't this great? We' _Jinally getting to know each otdr. You can't do that in an office.
BILLY => Well, in there, everything's business --
MARLA => Right. Now, let's talk strategy. You realize, this changes everything -- for you, me, the department...
BILLY => What does?
MARLA => Your relationship to Mister Clamp. Your access. I can see a future, Billy. I see more office space...embossed letterhead...I see us --  -- swallowing up the publicity department.
BILLY => Wow. I'm being open 4th Billy.- haven't talked abQu feelings with anyone.
BILLY => See, I usually don't pay too much attention to office politics and stuff. I have so much work to do on the illustrations --
MARLA => You have talent, Billy, and that's wonderful. It's a God-given blessing situation. But even an artist has to have goals.
BILLY => Definitely. It's like I was saying to Kate, I said, Honey, you know, for an artist -- Maria leans closer to Billy, her tone more intimate than before.
MARLA => I can help you reach those goals, Billy. If we join forces...
BILLY => Oh, we should definitely join -- Billy FEELS something in his lap. He looks down. It is Marla's stockinged FOOT.
BILLY => -- forces. Just at that moment --
CANADIAN WAITER => Sir? -- a WAITER appears at Billy's side, holding a platter containing a large MOOSE HEAD sculpted out of CHOCOLATE. Billy is so startled to find the moose staring at him that he SPILLS his beer in his lap. Maria quickly withdraws her foot, and Billy blots at the spill with a napkin.
CANADIAN WAITER => You okay there, sir? Another Molson there, eh?
BILLY => No, uh, thanks'. Everything's fine.
BILLY W => No, thanks, I, uh --I've rea y got to get going. I've got that -- appointment. I'm sorry about your, uh --
MARLA => Oh, that's okay --
MARLA => -- see you tomorrow.
BILLY => Good. Right. He escapes the r au rant.
KATE => Billy said to make sure and feed you before midnight... As she arranges chicken and mashed potatoes on a plate, Daffy spots a BLENDER next to him. He recoils from it -- then, with an evil grin, he shoves it off the counter while Kate's back is turned, BREAKING it. When she turns and looks, Daffy has an innocent loops" expression on his face.
KATE => Oh, God-you have to be careful here, okay, Gizmo? We don't have the money to replac things. Daffy nods contritely. Ka ings him the food.
KATEDNT. } => Let's see i f CWu ' l i eat this -- Daffy grabs a chick lig, opens his mouth as wide as Joe E. Brown's, clamps 0 -11 n the drumstick, and strips all the meat off in one fast ion, bringing out a spotless bone. With his other paw, Daffy tries the mashed potatoes. He hates them, and PITCHES what he's holding, getting half the wad on Kate and half on the refrigerator.
KATE => I don't know what Billy sees in you. Daffy WHOOPS, grabs more chicken, and resumes eating.
BILLY => Its me. She undoes the deadbolts and opens the door. Billy rushes in.
BILLY => Hi. I'm sorry I'm late -- He gives her a fast kiss on the lips -- and, as he lets go of her, sees that she's SPATTERED with food.
BILLY => What happened to you? Kate doesn't answer -- she looking at the LIPSTICK mark on Billy's face.
KATE => It's in the kitchen. Billy -- She FOLLOWS him to the kitchen.
BILLY => Did you feed him?
KATE => Yes --
BILLY =>  Hey, Giz, how you -- They come into the kitchen, which is a mess from Daffy's food, throwing. The Mogwai is hidden behind a little BARRICADE of Lean Cuisine boxes. As Kate and Billy enter, he THROWS a lump of frozen pineapple that nails Billy on the forehead. 
BILLY => Ow! Gizmo, what's -- Billy leans over the barricade and looks in -- as Daffy tosses a GLOP of cherry cobbler, splattering Billy's face.
BILLY => Kate ...Kate, where did you find this guy?
KATE => In your office -- near that drawer, where you said -- Billy, look out! Too late -- Daffy LOBS a single-serving PUDDING-PACK at Billy. It bursts on impact, staining his shirt.
BILLY =>  Where's Gizmo? The Mogwai SPITS, then wings Kate with a piece of Salisbury steak. Billy looks at the wall clic: it's 11:15.
BILLY => We've got to get over here.
KATE => Billy -- you said there weren't going to be those --
BILLY => There won't be. Not if they don't eat after midnight.
KATE =>  What about -- him?
BILLY => We'll have to take him with us. He snatches a Lean Cuisine box away and grabs Daffy, almost getting bitten in the process. Kate follows Billy as he takes the flailing Daffy into the living room and stuffs him into his leather daypack.
BILLY => You ever want to get out of there, you better relax. Daffy settles down to a low rumble.
BILLY => That's better. They grab their coats, start toward the door.
BILLY => Mister Wing was right...
KATE => About what?
BILLY => When he came to take Gizmo back. I asked him how come he could understand what Gizmo was saying... said you just had to know how isten. But he said I wasn't re cW t. For the 0 responsibili d I'm not -- As they reach the door, the ?q x ZZER sounds.
BILLY  5 => Great.
KATE => Who could it be this late?
KATE => Mister Futterman! Mrs. Futterman...
BILLY => We thought you were coming tomorrow --
MR. FUTTERMAN => We thought so too. The guys in my old outfit, they changed the date for the reunion. We tried to call
Greyhound. => tCONTI -
SHEILA => Thirty-two hours'. We're sorry to come here so late --
KATE => No, no, that's okay. Would you like some coffee, or --
SHEILA => No, don't you go to any trouble, hon.
04, 0 => 0o6s
MR. FUTTERMAN => Boy, we tried to get a cab up here -- did you know they have RUgsiLan guys drivin' cabs in this burg? What if somebody gets in one of those cabs with a briefcase full of atomic secrets? Is anyone thinking about that?
SHEILA => Murray, you remember what Doctor Kaplan said. We're going to stay nice and calm --  Murray was a little... distressed after, you know, what happened with those, um -- 
MR. FUTTERMAN => Aah, I'm fine. I was just a little jumpy for a while -- Billy's daypack SQUEAKS. Billy slips the bag under his arm and squeezes it, forcibly quieting Daffy.
MR. FUTTERMAN => What's that?
SHEILA => It's okay, honey. I hear it too.
MR. FURMAN => Of course you hea it too. What do you mean?
BIL => It's, uh -- plumbing here. It...makes n e sometimes. Sheila, looking at qty, spots something -- iE I LA Oh, Mur I think we interrupt these two.
MR. FUTTERMAN => Huh? Billy realizes what Sheila is talking about, as she takes out a handkerchief and dabs at the lipstick on his face.
BILLY => Oh, uh...that's from -- my boss. I did some stuff that she liked. I mean some work -- He tries to catch Kate's eye, but she avoids his look.
BILLY => Uh, the thing is -- I'm afraid you guys can't stay here. I mean, we'd love it if you could, but the, uh - - the building's being -- fumigated.
MR. FUTTERMAN => Bugs, huh? Yeah, you can't be careful these days. All k t weird bugs eosin' into +he country...
SHEILA => Oh. Well, that's okay, Billy --
MR. FUTTERMAN => Sure -- we'll just book into a } hotel.
BILLY => Really sorry ...we'll call you... He backs the Futtermans toward the door. AD LIB goodnights as Billy opens the door, forcing himself to look relaxed as the Futtermans go. He watches through the door for a beat, then closes it -- and finds Kate suspiciously eyeing his lipstick tattoo.
BILLY => What -- this? It was just one of those business things. You know, like -- "Great job." You don't believe me?
KATE => I believe you.
BILLY => We better get going.
CU => Yeah ...or, wait"rfre j't yep peanut butter cups all nui(/
LENNY => Yum! .and sloppily chow down. Up above, Yogurt Jerk I turns to the machine, sees the two spigots flowing. She's about to turn them off, but a complaining CUSTOMER stops her.
CUSTOMER 2 => Miss, I asked for Oreo cookies and Gummy Bears -- this stuff is, like -- hair.
CUSTOMER 2 => What is it? It's a t.!
LENNY => Yum!
CUSTOMER 3 => What's going on here? Did that woman say there are rats?
BILLY =>  What kind of thing was in the trail mix?
CUSTOMER 1 => I don't know, a fa= thing. And it's supposed to be health food. Billy checks the lobby clock -- 12:10. He Pulls Kate aside.
BILLY => That's it. It's after midnight, and they've eaten. Now they'll make their cocoons...and if they get to water --
40 KATE => Come on.
KATE => It's along here... They come to a deep, square RECESS in the wall. Inside is massive MACHINERY -- pipes, pumps, meters -- surrounded by a
KATE => This is where the water comes into the building.
BILLY => Great. Maybe if we shut it off, they'll even close the place down... Billy goes to a corner of the chain-link cage and starts bending links back from the seam, trying to make a big enough opening to slip through.
SUPERVISOR => Give me video. The technician types a command, and a video IMAGE of Billy attacking the cage appears on the screen.
SUPERVISOR => Guards.
GUARD => Back off! Put your hds up. Billy backs off the cage and ss a GUARD coming toward him, flashlight and gun in hand. As he gets close, Daffy starts bouncing around in the daypaelr again. The guard trains his gun on the leather bag.
GUARD => What's in the bag pal?,
BILLY => Nothing.
GUARD => Oh yeah? Let's have a look.
BILLY => You don't want to -- The guard ignores him, opens the zipper, and LOOKS DOWN into the bag.
GUARD => Aagghhh! When the guard pulls his head up, Daffy is hanging onto the guard's NOSE by his teeth. The guard flails his head furiously around, until Daffy finally flies free --
BILLY => No! -- and as the Mogwai's departing FOOTSTEPS are heard, the guard angrily puts Billy up against the wall, starts handcuffing him.
BILLY => We have to find him, before he eats something -- GUARD b5  He already ate some i Billy looks around for Kate then realizes she's hiding in the 0 shadows of the concrete recess, unnoticed by the guard.
BILLY => Look, we have to shut this building down. That thing that bit you -- there are more of them, okay? And they're going to turn into -- these Monsters, and --
GUARD => Tell you what, pal -- you can tell the cops all about these monsters, I'm sure they'll be very interested... As he takes Billy away, CAMERA holds on a spot over their heads...goes into a GAP between the concrete wall and ceiling ...and finds three big COCOONS. Their slimy bodies gleam dully in the yellow lamplight. As we watch, the cocoons silently GROW and change, gathering strength...
BILLY => Listen, I'm not crazy. People are going to be in a lot of danger. They wreck things. They kill people. If they get out of here, they'll destroy the whole city...they'll destroy everything. Listen to me...
BILLY => Thanks for getting  e out of there.
KATE => It was easy -- I just gave them a next month's rent.
BILLY => When we get there -- go to your job, like normal, okay? And just keep your eyes open. What time is it?
KATE => Six-thirty.
4II => They hit the early-scorning at a run.
GIZMO => Bil - lee -- -- but a GREEN CLAW GRABS HIM FROM BEHIND, jerking him backward, off his feet.
KATE => Billy, what if they're already -- Suddenly, the lobby LIGHTS DIM, d Billy looks up. BILLY t.0 They are. Come on..
Q) => He starts leading Kate toward e lobby NEWSSTAND. On the way, they run into Grandpa Fred.
GRANDPA  ,ED => Hey, Billy -- the-building's completely screwe p today --
BILLY =>  Fred. I know...
GRANDPA FRED =>  Sure. You're young. You know everything. Billy and Kate arrive at the newsstand, where Billy grabs four souvenir FLASHLIGHTS in the shape of the building.
56A. => is ?9 CONTINUED t 79
NEWSSTAND LADY => Eighty-six thirty-eight with tax.
BILLY =>  I'm going to go up and --  Now much?
NEWSSTAND LADY => Four times nineteen ninety-five --
BILLY => Put it on my bill.
BILLY => Remember, they can't stand bright light. If one of them gets near you -- He's interrupted as Marla comes up to them -- and gives Billy a squeeze and a kiss before he has time to think.
MARLA => Good morning, Billy. That was so aim, last night. We're going to have to do that again --
BILLY => Uh -- Marla, this is Kate, my --
MAR LA => Oops, I'd better get going. See you ui tairs, Billy.
ATE) => Hi.
BILLY => Uh, Kate -- listen, think I better explain --
KATE => Don't do any explaining right now, okay? I'm too mad. A guide calls Kate from the guide office.
GUIDE => Kate -- you're up, honey.
KATE => Excuse me. I have to go to work now.
BILLY I => But -- look, I'm going up to Systems Control. If I'm not back down here in fifteen minutes --
KATE => 0 Billy -- if we all get through today alive, you're in h,g, trouble.
BILLY => Kate -- f
BILLY => Terrific. As Billy heads for the elevators, HOLD on a nearby Miller's Outpost jeans store that opens onto the lobby. A couple of teenage girl SHOPPERS approach the SALES CLERK.
SHOPPER => Excuse me...do you have any styles that aren't, urn, fringed? They hold up several pairs of pants. All of them are "fringed" from the knees down -- as if they'd been CLAWED to tatters. From the store's back room, we HEAR a whoop. It's familiar, but the VOICE has become deep, raspy, and such less innocent.
DAFFY => Wa- !
BILLY => Mister Forster -- ? FORSTER Zs: Peltzer! What are you doing in this building? You got yourself arrested here last night, and you come back?  Get security up here. He's out. He starts to walk away, but Billy follows his.
BILLY => Mister Forster, we have to evacuate the building. Right now.
FORSTER => Oh, we do? Why's that?
BILLY => There are ... creatures in the building. They start out as these small, furry animals, but then they eat, and they go into cocoons, and then they become small, green --
FORSTER => This is drugs. It's got to be. You're on a groovy little trio, aren't you, Peltzer? Well, let me tell you something, Mister Flower Child --
BILLY => Just listen to me --
TECHNICIAN => Wait a mo. this is good. They start out rr d then they have the cocoons... V
BILLY => First they eat --
TECHNICIAN 2 => Well, sure. you're going into a cocoon, you want to have a little something first.
KATE => Sir -- I'm sorry, but you have to keep up with the rest of the group...
59A. => Katsuji responds by ZOOMING in on Kate with the video camera.
KATSUJI => Excellent! Thank you! Please give me some right profile as you continue speaking!
KATE => Uh, If we're very quiet, we can go in here and watch a program being videotaped...
MARGE => Now, this week here on "Microwave With Marge" is our special "Salute to Luncheon Meats" and I'm very , excited about t ecipes, so let's just jump k ome hors d'oeuvres. You kn t logna and bean dip roll-ups-a IS when friends drop over, and f I o want to make it a little extra special, you can get some of these little sword-shaped toothpicks, you put that through the bologna, and that's your "Viva Zapata" appetizer. People are simply crazy about these...
TECHNICIAN I => Okay, wait -- what if one of them eats something at eleven o'clock, but he gets something stuck in his teeth --
TECHNICIAN 2 => A caraway seed.
TECHNICIAN 1 => Whatever, right, and then after twelve o'clock, it comes out -- now, he didn't eat that after midnight --
BILLY => Look I didn't make the rules. There are --
FORSTER => "The rules." I can't believe this.
TECHNICIAN 2 => Or what about if he's eating in an airplane, and they cross the time zone -- But the technician's theory is cut short, as -- -- TWO GREEN ARMS BURST OUT OF HIS CONSOLE, ripping aside control buttons and speaker grilles in a burst of SPARKS AND
SMOKE. => Before the technician can move, the arms are going for his throat -- and MOHAWK, now a bloodthirsty Gremlin, emerges from the wreckage of the console, still CHOKING the technician.
TECHNICIAN 2 => Help -- me -- At the sight of Mohawirster jumps back. Technician 1 tries to move on the Gremli 34o awk takes a claw from his victim's neck and SLASHES a ian 1's arm, driving him back. Billy pulls out his building-shag plight and SHINES it at the Gremlin. Recoiling, the Gremlin s go of the technician, who falls to the floor -- dead.
MARGE => This is how we used to cook for big groups, before we had our microwave ovens and the other modern appliances. It would take days to plan the menu, and hours over a hot stove to do the cooking. But now, we can make this same tuna-noodle cheez-product chowder surprise in just a few minutes, and you can feed anything from a high school reunion to a complete chain gang with this kind of quantity.
MARGE => Whew! Now, if we step over here... But as she starts to turn away, the LIGHTS on the set suddenly
CAMERAMAN => Huh. Brownout or something. Marge HEARS a TAPPING noise from inside the soup pot. Confused, she lifts the lid -- and JUMPS BACK, as LENNY -- now a GREMLIN, but his dopey face still recognizable -- sits up in the soup pot, wearing a chef's hat, and SPLATTERS Marge with orange noodle-casserole GOO. He whips out a TURKEY EASTER, and SQUIRTS Marge with it.
0 .5 => Mi-cro-wave! Kate's tourists turn to FLEE the studio -- the last to go is Katsuji, who photographs the Gremlins a mile a minute as he backs out of the room. As the tourists go, the Gremlins turn savagely toward the ovens. George whispers to Lenny, who nods obediently and throws several METAL UTENSILS into the microwaves. The Gremlins close the ovens and start them up. The ovens fill with furious ARCS of blue light --
MARGE => Look out! -- and THE OVENS EXPLODE, showering the set with GLASS. As Marge and her cameraman escape the studio, the ovens catch FIRE. The flames lick up toward the ceiling -- -- and set off the SPRINKLERS. George and Lenny grin, standing tall to shower in the spray. As the water hits, BUBBLES appear on the Gremlins' backs. Close on the bubbles, CAMERA finds the tiny heads of GREMLIN OFFSPRING, getting ready to burst out. As the studio fills with the ominous SMOKE and COLORED LIGHT of Gremlin multiplication, Kate runs from the room.
TECHNICIAN 1 => Mister Forster, I show lighting brownouts in five locations.
TECHNICIAN 3 => I've got a climate control malfunction, floors fifteen and sixteen --
FORSTER => What the hell's going on?
TECHNICIAN 4 => Uh, air -- Forster goes over to Technician 4's station --
TECHNICIAN 4 =>  The Peat Infestation Monitor... -- and sees, on the technician's screen, an alarmingly rapid proliferation of DOTS, spreading over the diagram of the building. The dots started as a cluster in the cable TV studio area -- Microwave Marge's studio -- but they're spreading out to other floors, and moving around quickly. FORSTER is', What is that? That' 01 at rats, is it?
TECHNICI => No sir, I'm afraid s not -- A VIDEOPHONE RINGS near Technician 3; he grabs it.
KATE => 0 Is Billy Peltier there, please?
64./64A. => 89A CONTINUEDs 89A
TECHNICIAN 3 => No, he said he was going to Mister Clamp's office -- hey, do you know anything about --
KATE => Thank you.
KATE => Thirty-eight. But the VOICE that croaks back isn't the usual elevator voice.
THIR-TY-EIG => Kate's face registers She jams on the "DOOR OPEN" button, but the door stay And the elevator starts
MOVING... => .before it jerks to a sudden STOP:
Building, etc. => Clamp hits the switch on a desk INTERCOM.
CLAMP => HAve you shredded my mail from this morning?
SECRETARY =>  I'm just finishing, Mister Clamp.
CLAMP => Good. Let's do some memos...
JIMMY STEWART => Merry Christmas, movie house! Merry Christmas, drugstore... Scowling, Clamp pushes a button. The movie blossoms into garish, unlifelike COLOR.
CLAMP => You're not my secretary. The Gremlin responds by grabbing a SILEX POT of boiling-hot water from the nearby coffee station, and FLINGING the boiling water at Clamp -- -- who ducks it, as it SCALDS the paint on the wall behind him. Clamp makes a tentative move toward the Gremlin, who THROWS the empty Silex. It barely misses Clamp, and SMASHES against the wall. The Gremlin JUMPS at Clamp, who tries to bat it away from his face, like a kid panicked by a moth -- -- but his flailing knocks the Gremlin back, so that its foot is caught in the hopper of the secretary's SHREDDER. Hating to do it, using only his fingertips, Clamp PUSHES the struggling Gremlin down into the machine -- -- which SPRAYS him out of the bottom like a black, bloody, eyes-only memo of DEATU. As Clamp stands gasping de the machine, the door to the corridor opens, and Billlybu in. He sees the shredder, and 0 the tattered Gremlin remaips 4 j ng from it.
BILLY => Sir -- are you all right?
CLAMP => I think so..-.I hate using these machines myself.
BILLY => Sir, I have to talk to you. There are a -- The door opens again, and a dishevelled Forster bursts in.
FORSTER => Mister Clamp, there's a situation in --  My God, what --
BILLY =>  Sir, please listen to me. There are more of these things -- maybe lots more. We've got to get people out of the building -- and we've got to close the building up. We've got to do it before sundown.
CLAMP => Yeah? What happens at sundown?
BILLY => These -- things can't stand sunlight. It'll kill them. But once it's night time, they can get out, into New York. If that happens --
FORSTER => He should be in custody. He's dangerous.
AMP => Bangerous' is thing that was in here a min go -- that was dangerous. is 's from the art department. i
FORSTER => Yeah? Ask him how he knows so much about these -- green things.
CLAMP => That's a good question, Bill. How dQ you know about them?
BILLY => Well -- um, you know that genetics laboratory, down on --
CLAMP => Of course. Those guys.  I warned you that could be a problem tenant. We could have had three shrinks and a plastic surgeon in that space. But no...
ELEVATOR VOICE => You have requested a floor that is not part of the building at this time... And now Kate SEES CLAWS tearing at the corners of the elevator car, trying to gouge their way inside. The O.S. SOUND of GREMLIN LAUGHTER echoes in the elevator shaft. Kate shrinks into the middle of the floor, her hands braced against the walls --
LADY I => There are some nice shops here in the building...
LADY 1 => (indicates other
ELEVATOR) => We'll get the next one.
BILLY => Sir, we have to make sure that none of these -- things get wet. If that happens --
CLAMP => I'll tell you what we have to do. We have to get a lid on this thing and keep it on. No cops, no media. We'll handle it.  Go down to systems control and get on top of this thing.
FORSTER => Me? Um, but there might be --
LEWIS => Not me.
WALLY => Hey! My vegetable medley! Before Wally can stop him, a GREMLIN goes over to the potted VEGETABLE PLANTS with TUBES connecting them to a glass vial. He grabs the vial, EATS it...and stands still for a moment... .as his EARS turn into leafy clumps of ROMAINE LETTUCE. Wally tries to move on him, but the Gremlin menaces his with a claw, and goes on to grab a vial from a CAULIFLOWER PLANT... CHAOS ensues, as more Gremlins go after more vials and the scientists' efforts to stop them result mainly in trashed
EQUIPMENT => ANGLE on a Gremlin trying a vial marked SEX HORMONE. The Gremlin's face registers big consumer satisfaction -- he downs the rest of the vial in one gulp.
MARTIN => Oh no...
LEWIS => .not the brain hormone. The Gremlin swallows the vial...twitches for a moment. He painfully croaks out a few WORDS --
BRAIN GREMLIN => I...want...to -- Then, suddenly, the transformation takes hold, in thrashing Jekyll-and-Hyde HISTRIONICS that send the Gremlin rolling on the floor. When he stands, he wears a pair of HORN-RIMMED GLASSES, and SPEAKS FLUENTLY in a new VOICE, similar to that of
BRAIN` NLIN => .for example, at fellow over near the, I believ n ' + a common bat of the order -- the only mammals, I mig add, capable of true flight... Indeed, a GREMLIN is approaching cage of the BAT who's being 40 desensitized to light for messenge ing purposes. The Gremlin grabs a collecting VIAL connected by surgical tubing to the bat's body. The Gremlin swallows the vial, then stands watching, surprised, as his hands become WEBBED, like bat wings. While this: is happening, the Brain Gremlin walks over to the Bat Gremlin.
BRAIN GREMLIN => Nibs:: Brings ! Might I have a brief word' with you? The= t QrenLin:looks curiously at him.
BRAIN GREMLIN => My friend, you have...potential. I want to help you be all that you can be...may I? As he continues talking, he plucks the intravenous tube from the bat's body, and happily JAMS the needle into the. Bat Gremlin's skin. The bottle with the sunshine logo on it drains quickly...
BRAIN GREMLIN => You have wings, my friend. Flap them. The Bat Gremlin does -- and TAKES OFF, soaring near the ceiling as the twin scientists chase. him.
BRAIN GREMLIN =>  To the window, my friend! A world of possibilities opens itself to you! Throw off the old constraints... The Bat Gremlin wings toward one of the polarized glass windows...
BRAIN GREMLIN => There it is...the Apple...the city so nice they named it twice... check it out one time -- won't you? .and SMASHES THROUGH IT, leaving a jagged bat silhouette in the glass behind him. The other Gremlins shrink from the invading rays of SUNLIGHT, but the Bat Gremlin flies free...
GRANDPA FRED => .tonight we've got a classic horror movie, from Grandpa Fred's special dungeon -- Fred is interrupted by a MOAN -- not the normal weak moan on the tape, but a genuinely scary GREMLIN moan. He turns around, and sees a grinning GREMLIN emerge from behind the prop tombstone. As Fred heads back there, two other GREMLINS join the first one, and the three of them watch him intently.
DIRECTOR => Fred, what's the story with those -- things?
GRANDPA FRED => Uh.. .I don't... One of the Gremlins takes the reel of film from Fred, unreels a little from the loose end and holds it up. A second Gremlin looks at a frame -- mimes terrified shock, then CLUTCHES his chest and falls back onto the floor. The of e%.Gremlins LAUGH.
NO => Uh -- that ' s right, it ' s real ' scary -- The other two Gremlins put their f alongside Fred's and make scary snarls. They like it here
DIRECTOR => Boy, that's creepy. Okay, rolling...
GRANDPA FRED => Uh -- Grandpa Fred and his Friends have something horrible in store for you tonight... The Gremlins nod in gleeful agreement.
40 NEWSCASTER => .of major mechanical problems today at the Clamp Centre office i building. Reached by Hotline News, a spokesman for developer Daniel Clamp says there's nothing to worry about, that these are just the normal "glitches" that a new building goes through in the first few months. Turning to sports...
CUSTOMER 4 => My broker a ,g s the strongest things in the ecb i f ght now are cigarette' a np4s magazines.
CUSTOM => Really. IRY00 1-1
CUSTOMER 4 => Of course, he's been in jail for a while now... Customer 4 reaches under the salad bar's sneeze-guard with the plastic tongs to pull a clump of lettuce from the bin -- and is horrified to discover that he is holding an ALL-VEGETABLE MUTANT GREMLIN by the ear. This horribly smiling thing has RADISHES for eyes, CORN-row hair, CAULIFLOWER ears, STRINGBEAN lips and - - as it opens its mouth -- a darting WAX-PEPPER TONGUE. As other customers recoil, horrified, Customer 4 tries to drop the Vege-Gremlin, but, baring its sharp ARTICHOKE TEETH, it reaches out with CARROT fingers to grab his shirt and pull his THROUGH the sneeze guard.
116AA => In a Clamp Cable TV studio, LEONARD MALTIN is taping an "At the Movies"-type show called "THE MOVIE POLICE."
LEONARD MALTIN => And now for our videocassette consumer watch -- He gingerly holds up a videocassette of the first Gr,gmlins movie as if it is a long-dead fish.
LEONARD MALTIN => Here's one that's just been re- released on video, and if you're thinking of renting it, I can think of a lot of better things to do with three dollars... Leonard is unaware of the REAL GREMLINS that have snuck into the studio and are creeping up on him from behind ---

BROKER =>  What? Nothing. Think about those bonds. 'Bye. - The Gremlin points an accusing claw at the broker.
GREMLIN => Nice tie! The broker starts yanking the tie off, but the Gremlin SWIPES at him, and he beats it, as WIDER ANGLE REVEALS a number of OTHER GREMLINS also chasing brokers off, and grabbing their phones --
GREMLINS =>  Buy! Sell! Sell! Buy! Sell! SPOT the Brain Hormone Gremlin, kicked back in a broker's chair, talking on a phone.
BRAIN GREMLIN => .yes, I'd say it's a full-scale panic. Are you having a run on the banks there yet? Well, it's rather brutal here ...we're advising our clients to put everything they've got into canned food and shotguns.. . yes... The TICKER DISPLAY on the wall speeds up, going NUTS.

As a 4 ches it, a raincoat --wearing FLASHER GREMLIN blocks her way, a l'i#ks open his coat to flaunt his 0 reptilian underbelly. Kate KICKS the flasher Gremlin out%ofbf 6k way, and pulls the ALARM. In the Clamp Centre, of coot the fire alarm isn't some old-fashioned bell or siren. Instead, melodramatic MUSIC builds under a documentary-narrator VOICE --
FIRE VOICE => Fire! The untamed element... oldest of man's mysteries...
FIRE VOICE => Giver of warmth, destroyer of forests ... right now, this bu; i d ing is on fire...
WORKER => What?
WORKER 2 => Fire! Fire! PEOPLE from offices'start beating it toward the stairwell exit.
SHEILA => Oh, Murray -- what a beautiful building!
MR. FUTTERMAN => Beautiful? Looks like somethin' out of the dark ages. True, Saint Eva Marie's architecture is on the vy side ...as CAMERA notices the ornate windows and the cor 'te topped with spooky stone GARGOYLES -- ( Wait a minute. That one there...that's ' a`rgoyle...
SHEILA => What is it, Murray? It's the FLYING BAT-GREMLIN -- and it leaves its perch to fly
MR. FUTTERMAN => Hey'. Help! He flails at the Gremlin, batting it away from him, but it keeps coming back -- as Sheila stands back, too terrified to move --
SHEILA => Murray, what is it?
MR. FUTTERMAN => It's them!  Help me! Somebody help me! But the NEW YORKERS on the sidewalk continue past him, oblivious. Pjr.
SHEILA => Murray -- where are you going?
MR. FUTTERMAN => We have to tell Billy! Come on! Sheila follows him.
DR. CATHETER => The horror! The horror! The eakagg!
BILLY => What? What happened?

PROJECTIONIST => I quitt Cali the union'. can the National Guard! A MAN who has been getting popcorn at the nearby candy counter turns and comes over to the group. He is STEVEN SPIELBERG.
SPIELBERG => What seems to be the trouble here?
PROJECTIONIST => Those things! They've taken over the projector! They refuse to run the rest of the picture! They want to see Snow White Oral thg._yen Dwarfs!
SPIELBERG => Damn! I knew I should have directed this one myself!  Hulk... HULK HOGAN, in full wrestling regalia and carrying Raisinets, comes over to join Spielberg. Spielberg points a finger upward -- toward the projection booth in OUR THEATER. Hogan, quickly grasping the situation, addresses the Gremlins in the booth.

booth. => Grandpa Fred comes into the control room to find multiple MONITORS showing the signals of several New York TV STATIONS to a deserted room. As Fred watches, PAN three monitors showing NEWSPEOPLE in front of. the Clamp Centre Building. The scene behind the newspeople is chaos -- POLICE barricades, REFUGEES from the building, a CURIOUS CROWD, etc.
NEWSPERSON 2 => .stories about a fire, but also reports of an attack by some sort of animals -- again, none of this is confirmed...
NEWSPERSON 3 => .people who are quite hysterical, talking about some sort of "green men" -- unfortunately, police are not permitting any news media into the building at this time, so we're unable to bring you first-hand coverage, but as soon as... Fred's face registers what he's thinking: this is it. His break. He runs out into the corridor...
GRANDPA FRED => Hey!
KATSUJI => Yes?
GRANDPA FRED => Can you work a TV camera? Katsuji smiles proudly.
KATSUJI => Work a camera? I master the camera!
MARLA => Great.

She develops an instant crush on Forster, her HEART pounding half-out of her chest. The Girl Gremlin jumps up onto Forster's chest, embraces his neck, and moves in for a KISS.
FORSTER => Get it off me -- But Dr. Catheter is rushing to a CABINET at the back of the lab...
DR. CATHETER => I've got some small assault weapons...
CLAMP => .just tell then everything's under control, we've just had a few Clamp stops as he SEES a wall monitor with a ''CLAMP NEWS NETWORK" sign under it. Grandpa Fred stands amid the LOBBY CARNAGE, covered by Katsuji's slightly jerky hand-held CAMERA 0 Clamp, whitening, flicks the SOUND on.
GRANDPA FRED => .this invasion by strange creatures, perhaps from another galaxy...or a dimensional warp...
CLAMP => Dracula...? As Fred speaks, Katsuji's CAMERA catches a fast GLIMPSE of GREMLINS in kids' clothes frolicking past in b.g. It's hard for Fred to shake his horror-movie training --
GRANDPA FRED => .and, just a moment ago, in a spine-t. 1 ing, blood-chilling incident -- (catches himself -- turns newsy) -- uh, they continue to plague this troubled structure throughout what has been a turbulent and tumultuous afternoon...
CLAMP => Oh, shit.
NEWSPERSON 2 => Look, just let us in there. We'll take the responsibility --
COP => Forget it, pal. Most of the people are out of there ow, anyway.
NEWSPE ?.0 => Then what's in ther been in Beirut --
COP => Yeah? I bet they miss you there.  Let's move back, folks..,
CUT TO => Two FIRE ENGINES have pulled up outside the building. As FIREMEN connect their hoses to hydrants, COPS push the CROWD back to clear a path to the door for the firemen. As the breathless FUTTERMANS arrive at the building, they SEE a TV NEWSPERSON interviewing the nearly hysterical Microwave Marge beside the door.
MARGE => .and, and then these horrible green things came into the kitchen, and they, they put all kinds of metal utensils and cookingware into the units, the ovens, which you should never, it's not like your conventional oven, it produces a, a reaction, and it explode!d, and the horrible things were, they were laughing, and -- Hearing this, Mr. Futterman pushes his way to the entrance and blocks the firemen's path. MR. FUTTERMAN q, Hold it! Wait! No water!
FIREMAN => What?
MR. FUTTERMAN => It's not fire in there -- it's gremlins. If you get water on 'em, they just mu1 in1v.  You gotta let me in there. I know how to deal with it.
SHEILA => Murray -- The cop blocks Mr. Futterman's way.
COP => Uh, sure, pal -- look, why don't you calm don a little? Just --
TTERMAN => Don't talk t'&Jre Uke I'm crazy --  I was ner craz ' fine.
CLAMP => Bill -- how's it going out there? Any progress? Just tell me there's progress.
BILLY => I'm afraid it's pretty bad right now, sir --
CLAMP => Bad? It's horrible. There are people in this building. Real lives. You have any idea what kind of lawsuits we're looking at here?
BILLY => Yes sir. We'll have to But as he speaks, the ELECTRIC GREMLIN emerges from a wall socket behind Clamp...
BILLY => Watch out!
CLAMP => Help -- Billy grabs the RECEIVER of a VIDEO-PHONE end steps between Clamp and the Electric Gremlin. At the last possible instant, he holds the receiver up in the Electric Gremlin's path. The glowing beast touches the mouthpiece... .DISAPPEARS inside...and shows up an instant later on the video-phone's SCREEN -- trapped, writhing in pain, as RECORDED VOICES bounce around it and issue from the phone's SPEAKER.
BILLY => He's in the phone system...on hold. That should take care of him for a while.
RECORDED VOICE => While waiting, we invite you to listen to a brief interlude of recorded music.
CLAMP => Uh, Bill -- thanks.
BILLY => Sure. Mister Clamp, we have to stop these things from leaving the building. If they get out, that's it for New York -- at least New York. Clamp nods gravely, and takes a VIDEOCASSETTE from a drawer.
CLAMP => I thought this would never run, Bill -- but maybe it will.
BILLY => What is it?
CLAMP => The sign-off. The b sign-off
ANNOUNCER => Because of the end of civilization, the Clamp Cable Network now leaves the air. We hope you have enjoyed our programming -- but, more important, we hope you have enjoyed-life. As the montage continues, a Tiffany-type POP SINGER sings a sprightly version of an old hymn:
SINGER => Yet in my dreams I be Nearer my God to thee... Clamp, watching, wipes away a tear.
CLAMP => It's beautiful, isn't it?
BILLY => Yes -- listen, sir, can you set the clocks in the building ahead three hours? All of them?
CLAMP => Bill, there's nothing we can't do in this building. Why?
BILLY => Sunlight kills these things. That's why they're still in here. But when it's sundown -- or when they think it is -- they'll all get together in one place, so they can go out. They'll all be in the lobby.
CLAMP => Right. That's the only way out -- the front doors. He takes out a pocket computer-scheduler, c-- pushes a few buttons. ` 0 CLAMP (CONg. 0 0 The sun sets at -
BILLY => So around four-twenty -- just before they try to leave -- that's when we can make our move.
CLAMP => I like that. They're off balance, we've got information they don't -- that's when you can really take someone out. What j. our move?
BILLY => It's just an idea...you'll have to set it up. From outside the building, if you can get out there.
CLAMP => Yeah I've got my own entrance. You should get out too.
BILLY => There's some things I still have to take care of in here. Things and. .people.
CLAMP => This idea of yours --
BILLY => Yeah. It's going to be tricky. But if it works -- you could save the city.
CLAMP => Save the city. "Developer Saves City." Good. Shoot.
MARLA => Isn't anybody around here? Come on...I nee light in my -- Suddenly, Marla is startled by a BOOMING AMPLIFIED VOICE -- the subliminal tapes from the Systems Control Center, jacked up to more-than-audible volume.
MALE VOICE => -- not stealing office supplies works for me, and the way I live today...
MARLA => What?
NEWSPERSON 1 => Mister Clamp, is it true the building's been evacuated?
NE'SPERSON 2 => Sir, is the building on fire?
CLAMP => No, no --  That's a false alarm. We've just got some problems --
NEWSPERSON 3 => Problems? You've got a guy in a Dracula costume in there, broadcasting stuff with little green monsters. Are you trying to panic New York City? CLAMP Ln Absolutely not. 1.10
SHEILA => Murray! -- but Mr. Futterman pushes the button, and he's below street level before anyone can catch bin.
BILLY => Kate...? .a WIND STORM comes out of the VENTS. PAPERS from nearby offices swirl into the corridor. As Billy bats the flying memos away and struggles against the wind, he hears a NOISE in a nearby office, and goes inside to investigate.
(" b => . in an even more bizar t 0 that one of the ores " creatures," is that I u ate? The Brain Gremlin nods.
GRANDPA FRED => -- who is able to talk, and he's going to talk with us now.  I think the main question people have is -- what is it you want? The Brain Gremlin answers in his usual cultured tones, sounding lucid.
BRAIN GREMLIN => Fred, what we want is, I think, what everyone wants, and what you and your viewers have -- civilization,
BRAIN GREMLIN => The niceties, Fred. The fine points. Diplomacy. Compassion. Standards, manners, tradition. That's what we're reaching toward. Oh, we may stumble along the way, but -- civilization, yes. The Geneva Convention. Chamber music. Susan Sontag. Everything your society has worked so hard to accomplish over the centuiries -- that's what we aspire to. We want to be civilized. I mean, you take a look at this fellow here... On TV, a DOPEY-LOOKING GREMLIN wanders into FRAME, grinning stupidly, waving at Fred's O.S. CAMERA. The Brain Gremlin reaches out of FRAME, comes back with a GUN, and SHOOTS the dopey Gremlin. The bar Gremlins love it.
BRAIN GREMLIN => Now, was that civilized? No. Clearly not. i Fun, but in no sense civilized... On TV, Fred starts backing nervously away from the armed Gremlin.
GRANDPA FRED => Well ...uh, of course that could be argued different ways... As the bar Gremlins live it up 'VA E PANS to the front doors of the

FIRE CHIEF => What's this thing for?
E CLAMP => These things can only come out when it's dark. We've put all the clocks in the building ahead three hours. When they think it's sunset...and they see what a nice "night" it is outside... they'll all be in the lobby, getting ready to come out. When they do, we drop this backdrop ...and let the sunlight fry 'em.
FIRE CHIEF =>  Where'd you find this thing?
CLAMP => It's from a musical I was backing on Broadway. The one about Stalin. It closed last week.
FIRE CHIEF => Oh, I saw that. Boy, that guy could d c e.
( ( => The bar Gremlins are still watching T c hihremlin is crazily filibustering.
BRAINGREMLIN => We want the essentials, Fred. Dinettes. Bar stools. Complete bedroom groups. Convenient credit, even if we've been turned down in the past. Fred, am I losing you here...?
EYES -- => Billy flails desperately, but it just leaves his mouth unprotected. Daffy wedges a CLAW in, moves in with the drill ---
MR. FUTTERMAN => You okay, Billy?
BILLY => Yeah. Mr. Futterman, what are you doing here?
MR. FUTTERMAN => I knew you'd need help, kid. I wasn't gonna let you down. What's next?
ILLY => I was tr o find Kate.
SEES -- => KATE rounding the corner of the corridor, flashlight in hand.
MARLA => Thank God you're here...
KATE => I could just leave you there. It seems to be good for your attitude.
MARLA => Look -- about Billy. Nothing happened. Really. I asked him to go out to dinner with me, but it was just business. 40 Kate shakes her head, impatient.
MARLA => Okay. Wait. I'm going to be honest with you. It'll be a cathartic openness thing. It wasn't business. I tried to get something going with him. But I couldn't get to first base. Does that help?
KATE => It'll do. She reaches into her purse, and pulls out a Swiss Army KNIFE. But as she starts cutting Marla down, Marla SEES something else, and SCREAMS --
00 5L => They HEAR Kate's SCREAM O.S., an in the direction it came from. 615h
SYLVESTER STALLONE => To survive a war, you've got to become war. Holding the drawn bow and arrow in front of him, he PIVOTS on the display case, so that the match SCRATCHES against the wall, and CATCHES FIRE -- -- and, as Billy and Mr. Futterman round the corner, they SEE Gizmo loose the arrow -- -- which catches Spider-Mohawk in mid-body. The FLAMES spread over his body and to his hairy legs as he writhes, tumbles over, and DIES. Billy rushes to cut the women free with a pocket knife, as Mr. Futterman looks at Gizmo, up on the display case.
MR. FUTTERMAN => What's that?
BILLY => 0 That's Gizmo, Mister Fu tprtt He's on our side. Mr. Futterman gives Gizmo a hand down from the display case.
MR. FUTTERMAN =>  Uh...thanks. Gizmo responds with a quick, Stallone-style nod, as Kate and Billy embrace.
KATE => Billy --  What happened to him?
BILLY => I guess they -- pushed him too far.
BILLY => Thank God you're okay.
KATE => I am now.
BILLY => Well -- Gizmo got wet, and then the Mogwais ate after midnight, and then some of the Gremlins must have mutated, from the genetic material.
MARLA =>  Oh.
BILLY => And if these things get out of here now --
MR. FUTTERMAN => We'll stop 'em, Billy. I'll tell you something -- ever since these guys attacked us, back in Kingston Fails, I've been scared it would happen again. But now that it happened...I'm_not seared.
BILLY => How come?
KATE =>  Please --
MR. FUTTERMAN => What's wrong?
KATE => I'm sorry, it's -- Lincoln's birthday. Something terrible happened on Lincoln's birthday one year, and ever since then...
BILLY => I don't think we have tlie Kate. Let's no. `,
BRAIN GREMLIN => Is everybody here? A CHEER of assent from the Gremlins.
BRAIN GREMLIN => All right then... The Brain Gremlin holds a SPORTSCOAT over one shoulder, Frank Sinatra--style. As he nears the doors, he starts SINGING "New York, New York," with the GREMLINS SINGING the backup horn part behind him 
GRANDPA FRED => ...it seems incredible, but following their bl _urdijnif rampage a destruction, these creatures are now mounting what appears to be a production number...
MR. FUTTERMAN => Hey, these guys aren't bad --
KATE => Billy, they're going to the doors... Billy points at the dark-glass WINDOWS over the lobby.
BILLY => Don't worry. In a few seconds, Mister Clamp's going to drop that cloth out there. The sunlight will come in, and --
KATE '4'0 => Sunlight? On the: unwelcome SOUND of a` THUNDERCLAP,
MR. FUTTERMAN => If those guys get out there in the rain -- this town's going under for the third time.
KATE => Billy, we've got to do something.
BILLY => I know -- 0065
BILLY => Mr. Futterman. Get that hose. Aim it into the lobby.
MR. FUTTERMAN => Into the lobby? Are you nuts?
BILLY => Just do it. Do it fast...Kate, get a box, and put Gizmo in it...keep him dry... Down in the lobby, the happy Gremlins keep moving toward the doors...
BILLY => Kate, there's a call on hold in Mister Clamp's office. Can you transfer it down here without going up there?
KATE => Oh God -- I think so --
BILLY => Hurry. Kate hurriedly hands Marla the box containing Gizmo.
KATE => Here -- Atpn't let him get wet. Does it bit From the box, Gizmo TWITTEje&entfully.
BRAIN GREMLIN => It's up to you, New York, New -- .but before he can open it, WATER splashes onto the lobby's doors, its windows, its floor... .and the Gremlins, delighted, turn to catch the spray. Their SKIN starts to BUBBLE. CAMERA finds miniature GREMLINS in the bubbles, as the lobby fills with the rising SMOKE AND LIGHT of Gremlin replication...
KATE => .tap into the PBX. .back through the voice mail module ...main switchboard... into the Ethernet... five-digit code --
BILLY => That's it'. On the screen of the video-phone, the ELECTRIC GREMLIN writhes in agony, trying to gel off Hold, as the plastic button BLINKS beneath the screen. Billy grabs the phone fr d Kew,. lifts the receiver and holds it out over the mezzanine rani He looks down at the happily showering Gremlins -- -- PUSHES the blinking button dow -- and sees the Electric Gremlin SHOOT OUT OF THE RECEIVER, swooping down into the lobby --
SCREAMS... => .as the threatened invasion of all New York becomes a sodden, viscous puddle of green, churning protoplasm that swamps the lobby... .and our heroes sigh with relief, their bodies untensing...
CLAMP => It's okay, guys.  Maybe we can use this stuff as land fill... Grandpa Fred and Katsuji rush over to Clamp.
GRANDPA FRED =>  We're here exclusively with -- Clamp waves Fred and Katsuji to a stop. Fred lowers the mike.
CLAMP => Excuse me there, pal. Who told you to go on my network with all that coverage today?
GRANDPA FRED => Um -- nobody, sir. It just -- seemed like news, and I.,.

CLAMP => Marla. You work for me, don't you?
MARLA => Yes, sir. Very, very hard. Clamp nods, looks at her -- as if for the first time. Something promising passes between them... .as the doors to the building open, admitting Sheila Futterman and a small crowd of REPORTERS. Sheila sloshes hurriedly through the goo to Murray's side.
MR. FUTTERMAN => They tried it again, Sheila. But we were ready for 'em.  We're going home, guys. See you... The Futtermans exchange goodbye WAVES with Billy and Kate, and leave. The reporters latch onto Marla...
REPORTER => What happened here?
MARLA => Oh, it was a complete nightmare disaster. We had to stop work completely... .as Billy and Kate commisserate with Clamp.
BILLY => I'm sorry about the building, sir.
CLAMP => I'm not.
KATE MUN => You're not?
CLAMP => For one thing, we're insured for the damage. For another...maybe it wasn't for people anyway. It was a place for things. You make a place for things...
BILLY => Well, you kept the city safe.
CLAMP => That's right. That's a good point. The sacrifice...you know, this could be good in my next book. I should be taking notes. You have any paper?
BILLY => Let me see... Re rummages -- comes up with paper and pencil from his pockets and hands them to Clamp. But as Clamp unfolds the paper --
CLAMP => Wait a minute -- what's this?
RAND => That's Kingston Falls.
CLAMP => This is what I'm looking for.
BILLY => You want to move there?
CLAMP => I want to bu it. My new project, over in Jersey -- this is terrific! This is what people want now -- the traditional community thing. Quiet little towns! Back to the earth --  Is this your concept?

RAND =>  The Peltzer overcoat. in a Can. Personal waterproofing, for those who can not afford wetness.  May I demonstrate? Gizmo looks at Rand, and nods somberly, Stallone-style. Billy holds him up, and Rand SPRAYS the chemical over his body.
RAND (CONT.} => Boy, if I'd have finished this stuff a few days sooner, we could have saved everyone a lot of trouble. Kills you when that happens... He finishes spraying -- and takes out a WATER PISTOL.
