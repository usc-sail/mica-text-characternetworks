NEWSIES => FADE IN:
KLOPPMAN => Ink's wet, the presses are rolling, the papers are stacking -- rise and shine, make a dime, no news without the Newsies -- etc. Jack jumps out of his bunk and shakes the BOY below.
JACK => Wake up, Crutchy -- The World is waitin'.
RACETRACK => THAT'S MY CIGAR...
SNIPESHOOTER => YOU'LL STEAL ANUDDER. The boys begin to wake,                          KID BLINK yawning, stretching,                HEY BUMMERS, WE GOT WORK TO DO complaining as they hit the floor: pants pulled                         SPECS on, suspenders hitched             SINCE WHEN DID YOU BECOME up, boots laced tight.

NEWSIE => Hey, whattaya?
MUSH => How'd you sleep, Jack? JACK On me back, Mush.
CRUTCHY => Jack, this look like I'm fakin' it? He hobbles towards Jack on one crutch.
JACK => Who says you're fakin' it?
CRUTCHY => The streets are fulla fakes these days -- it's hurtin' the rep of genuine articles like myself. I gotta find me a new sellin' spot, where they ain't used to seein' me. Jack smiles; Mush taps Crutchy on the arm... sings. MUSH TRY BOTTLE ALLEY OR THE HARBOR
RACETRACK => TRY CENTRAL PARK IT'S GUARANTEED JACK TRY ANY BANKER, BUM OR BARBER Jack rinses his face, takes                  SKITTERY             * special care adjusting his      THEY ALMOST ALL KNOWS HOW TO red bandana.                      READ KID BLINK I SMELL MONEY

CRUTCHY =>  No rain -- partly cloudy, clearin' towards evenin'.  Who ya sellin' wit, Jack?
JACK => Ain't decided yet. Jack spots a passing wagon and helps Crutchy on board -- he and Mush jump on for the ride and they all move off --
DAVID => Les, hurry up, willya? Why do I gotta be saddled with you?
LES => Why do I gotta be saddled with you?
DAVID => Come on -- They'll run out of papers!
KID BLINK => 'Mornin', Officer. OFFICER I'm keepin' my eye on you, Blink.
KID BLINK => And I'll keep my eye on you, too, sir. OFFICER Get moving! Blink and the boys race into an alley --

KID BLINK => Say, Cowboy -- I hear Medda's breakin' in a new act at the vaudeville tonight -- ya interested? 
CRUTCHY => Stupid question.
KID BLINK => That an echo? Or is the Crip followin' ya again? CRUTCHY (swinging his crutch) Yeah? How'd you like it if a crip cracked your head?
JACK => Better choke it, Blink -- 'fore you need another patch. KID BLINK Hey, who ya sellin' wit, Jack? CRUTCHY Not wit you! JACK Nothing personal, Blink, but...
JACK => IT TAKES A SMILE AS SWEET AS BUTTER CRUTCHY THE KIND THAT LADIES CAN'T As Jack sings, the boys             RESIST listen carefully. They all respect his opinion.                       RACETRACK IT TAKES AN ORPHAN WITH A STUTTER

HEADLINE? => 
RACETRACK =>  Dear me. What is dat unpleasant aroma? I fear de sewer has backed up during de night. 
OSCAR => Inna back, ya ugly little shrimp! Oscar and Morris glare at the crowd, daring anyone to do anything about it. Jack calmly walks Snipe back to his place in line, then faces the Delanceys who try to stare him down. The air is electric. Nearby -- RACETRACK Five to one, I say Cowboy skunks 'em -- who's bettin', who's bettin' -- The Newsies shake their heads.    Nearby the staring contest continues until -- JACK You shouldn't be callin' people ugly little shrimps. Oscar. Unless you're referrin; to the family resemblance in your brother here. The brothers glower, look at each other, then back at Jack, who grins at them. JACK That's right. It's an insult. And so's this -- Jack deftly reaches out both hands and flips the derbys off both their heads. The brothers scramble for them and the chase is on.
THE HEADLINE => 
DAVID => Watch it, willya? What do you think you're doing!
JACK =>  Runnin'.
MUSH                                        * => Comin' down de chute!
MORRIS => We ain't finished with you yet, Kelly. The gatekeeper unlocks and swings open the huge gates.                 * Jack hangs on.
BOOTS => Ride 'em, cowboy!
JACK => Ya miss me, Weasel?
WEASEL => You know my name -- it's Weisel. Mister Weisel to you. How many?
JACK => Don't rush me -- I'm perusin'                          * the mercandice... Mr. Weasel.                          * The Newsies love it as Jack deliberately takes a paper, turns and scans.  Seeing Les staring at him, Jack winks. Les smiles back, fascinated. Jack turns back to Weasel with a fifty-cent piece. JACK The usual. Weasel grabs for the coin -- Jack flips it out of his            * grasp and onto the counter. The Newsies whoop. WEASEL Hundred for the wiseguy -- next!                       *
JACK => scans the newspaper for a catchy headline; Race, Crutchy, the others wander up, doing the same. A commotion O.S. and they look up to see -- -- at the window, Weasel is in David's face.                     *
WEASEL => Ya got ya papes -- move outta here.                    * DAVID I paid for twenty -- you only gave                     * me nineteen! 
DAVID => I want that other paper. The Delanceys start for David when suddenly Jack steps                 * up, slams his hand on David's papers, closes his eyes                  * and does a flip-count. The expert.                                     * JACK Nineteen, Weasel. An honest mistake -- on account of Oscar                            * can't count to twenty with his                            * shoes on.                                                 * Weasel glowers -- but wants to get back to business.         He backhands Morris who looks surprised. WEASEL Next! JACK Hold it.   Race -- spot me two-bits. Race flips him a coin.     Jack slaps it on the counter. JACK Another fifty for my friend here. DAVID I don't want another fifty -- ! JACK  Sure you do. Every newsie wants more papes.
DAVID => These papers are yours, I don't                           * take charity from nobody! I don't                         * even know who you are --
JACK => That and a lotta other things -- including Jack Kelly, which is what my mudder called me. What do they call you, kid?
LES =>  Les. This is David, he's my brother. He's older.
JACK =>  No kiddin'. How old are you, Les? LES Near ten. JACK No good. Anybody asks, you're seven.  Younger sells more papes, Les -- and if we're gonna be partners -- DAVID Hold it! Who said anything about partners -- ? JACK You owe me two bits, right? Okay, so I consider it an investment. We sell together, split 70-30, plus you get the benefit of observin' me -- no charge. CRUTCHY  You're gettin' the chance of a lifetime here -- you learn from Jack, you learn from the best. DAVID If he's the best, then why does he need us? 
DAVID => Gotta split fifty-fifty.
JACK => Sixty-forty.   Or I forget the whole t'ing. David reluctantly offers his hand. Jack spits in his palm and shakes. Les whoops and they move off, Jack already being the mentor -- JACK The name of the game is volume, Dave. You only took twenty papes -- why?
DAVID => Bad headline...? JACK First t'ing you gotta learn -- headlines don't sell papes, newsies sell papes. We're what holds this town together -- without newsies, nobody knows nuttin'! They move away from Newsie Square as above them, the GOLDEN DOME OF THE WORLD BUILDING glistens in the morning sun.
PULITZER =>  'Trolley Strike Drags On for Third Week' -- this so-called headline drags on for infinity! 
SEITZ => Just the Newsies, Chief, I'll --
SEITZ => Creating the World, Chief.                             *
PULITZER => This paper's losing money because there's too much fat, inefficiency -- not because I'm fighting to                         * make us number one! Well, we're going to cut costs, maximize profits -- and still beat the socks off Hearst --  I want to know how by tonight.
JACK => Some newsies got corners, see -- same spot, same customers. Me,                         * I like to keep moving, enjoy the life of the big city. I spot an opportunity, I sell a pape. That's the advantage of being an independent businessman, instead                       * of workin' for wages.                                  *
DAVID => Paper, mister? Without breaking the kiss, the man kicks out at David who jumps away. Shaking his head, Jack whispers something to Les, who rushes over to the Lovers, still kissing.
LES =>  Extry -- 'Runaway Carriage Crushes Cop!'
LES => He gimme a dime! He said I should go far away and keep the change!
JACK => You're a natural, kid. You remind me of me -- and I can't say greater than that.
DAVID =>  Extra, 'Trolley strike drags on!' JACK  Nextry, nextry -- 'Ellis Island in flames -- big con-fla-gration!'
DAVID => What -- ?   Where's that story -- ? JACK  Page nine -- thank you, sir. Nextry, 'Thousands flee in panic -- '
DAVID =>  'Trash fire near immigration building frightens seagulls -- ?'
JACK => 'Terrified flight from flaming inferno!' Thank you, much obliged -- 
LES => Buy me last pape, mista...?
DAVID => Our father taught us not to lie.
JACK => Mine taught me not to starve. So we both got an education.
DAVID => You just make things up -- like those headlines. JACK I don't do nothin' the guys who write this stuff don't do. It ain't lyin' -- it's just improvin' the truth a little. Les comes running back, wiping his mouth, with a quarter. LES The guy gave me a quarter! Quick, gimme some more last papers! DAVID  Hold it -- I smell beer! LES The guy bet me I wouldn't drink some -- that's how I made the quarter!
JACK => Hey, no drinkin' on the job -- it's bad for business. What if somebody called a cop or somethin'?
JACK => Beat it -- the bulls! He races off. David, confused, races after him, Les looks very worried as he runs with David --
LES => Just for one little sip of beer -- ?
SNYDER => You, Sullivan! Stop, I say!     You hear me, Sullivan? DAVID Who's Sullivan -- ? JACK Mistaken identity -- all micks look alike to these birds!
LES =>  One sip! I didn't even swallow it! Jack leads them into the doorway of --
SNYDER => You young miscreant! Wait'll I get you back to the Refuge!
DAVID => The Refuge -- ? 
DAVID => I'm not crossing that! Anyway, I don't think they're chasing us --
JACK => No?   What're they doin' then? DAVID I think they're chasing you! Snyder and MacSwain huff out onto the roof. David, still uncertain, looks back at them -- the runs across the plank. Jack calmly topples the plank to the street as the pursuers reach it, gasping for breath -- he gives Snyder a little salute, then moves on to a rooftop exit --
LES => You were in jail...?   Why?
JACK => I was starvin'. I stole some food. DAVID  Right, food. He called you 'Sullivan' -- JACK  Yeah, food. My name's Kelly, Jack Kelly, like I told you. Think I'm lyin'? DAVID You have a way of 'improving the truth.' Why was he chasing you?
JACK => Because I escaped. LES  Oh, boy. How? JACK This big shot gimme a ride out in his carriage. DAVID  Bet it was the mayor, right? JACK Nah. Teddy Roosevelt.    Ever heard of him? David starts to reply when he sees something behind Jack             * that makes his mouth drop open. At the top of a short                * flight of stairs, a vision is frowning down at them,                 * speaking in a theatrical Swedish accent.                             * 
JACK => You wouldn't kick me out without a kiss goodbye, wouldya, Medda? Surprised, she gasps in delight -- throwing her arms around Jack. David can't believe it. Medda's accent quickly disappears. MEDDA Kelly, where've you been, kid? I miss you up in the balcony -- you know I sing all my songs to you.
JACK => This is David and Les. And this is the greatest star of the vaudeville stage today, Miss Medda Larkson, the Swedish Meadowlark. MEDDA  Welcome! JACK Medda also owns the joint.
MEDDA =>  Don't ever own a theater, kid. Don't even think about it. DAVID  I won't. I promise.
MEDDA =>  What have we here -- ? Aren't you the cutest little fella that ever was -- yes, you are -- 
MEDDA => This kid is good. Speaking as one professional to another, I'd say you got a future.
JACK => Okay if we hang here awhile, Medda? 'Til a little problem outside goes away?
MEDDA => As long as you like -- now the lark must warble. Hey, you -- (flags down a passing candy butcher) -- give my guests whatever they want.
MEDDA =>  'MY LOVEY-DOVEY BABY'... etc.
DAVID => It's late, my folks'll be worried ... What about yours? JACK They're out west lookin' for a place for us to live -- (takes something from his pocket) -- like this. It's the cover of a dime novel with a blue-perfect sky over a perfect yellow desert; a large red sun shines down on a perfect adobe.
JACK => That's Sante Fe -- out in New Mexico? Soon's Pop finds us the right ranch, they're sendin' for me. LES  Then you'll be a real cowboy...
DAVID => Why don't we divvy up at my place...? You can meet my folks...
MOB => Scabs!   Soak the scabs!   Etc.
DAVID => Jack -- let's get outta here -- ! The boys move away, Jack looking back at the beating. JACK Maybe tomorrow we get a decent headline.
ESTHER =>  My God...! What happened?
DAVID => He's just sleeping, Momma --
MAYER => We've been waiting dinner -- where've you been? David says nothing; crosses to the table and dumps the day's receipts on it, looks up at his father proudly.
MAYER => You made all this selling papers...? 
MAYER => Esther -- maybe David's partner would like to stay for dinner. Add some more water to the soup. ESTHER  Mayer...! Mayer laughs, joined by Sarah and David -- and finally Esther herself as she waters the soup. Jack stands drinking in the family's warmth.
JACK => What I saw today, I gotta say your boys are born Newsies, Mr. Jacobs. With my experience and their hard work -- just a little more, thanks --  -- I figure we can peddle a thousand a week and not break a sweat.
MAYER => That many...? JACK More when the headline's good.
SARAH => What makes a headline good?
JACK =>  'Scuse the language there, uh, maybe I'm talkin' too much...
MAYER =>  You talk fine, Jack -- Sarah, get that cake your mother's been hiding in the cabinet! ESTHER That's for your birthday tomorrow! MAYER I've had enough birthdays!    This is a celebration! David leaps up to fetch silver; Sarah gets a luscious chocolate cake from a cabinet -- DAVID It's only the beginning -- the longer I work, the more I'll make -- MAYER You work only until I go back to the factory! Then you go back to school, like you promised.
LES =>  'Gimme all ya got, baby...'
JACK => How'd your pop get hurt? DAVID The factory. An accident.  He's no good to them anymore so they just fired him. He's got no union to protect him.
MAYER => David?   Time to come in now. Jack looks in at the warm family tableau: the lullaby, Sarah reading to Mayer. David, going in, sees his friend's expression. DAVID Why don't you stay here tonight...? JACK I got my own place... but thanks.                      * Your family's real nice, Dave.                         * * Like mine.                                             * David nods, climbs in the window.                                 * DAVID See you tomorrow. Carryin' the banner.
JACK =>  Carryin' the banner.
JACK => SO THAT'S WHAT THEY CALL A FAMILY MOTHER, DAUGHTER; FATHER, SON GUESS THAT EVERYTHING YOU HEARD ABOUT IS TRUE  
JACK => AND I'M FREE LIKE THE WIND Still singing,               LIKE I'M GONNA LIVE FOREVER Jack drops off the fire      IT'S A FEELING TIME escape into the alley;       CAN NEVER TAKE AWAY moves to the sidewalk        ALL I NEED'S A FEW MORE DOLLARS and walks off.

sidewalk. => JACK How'd it go at the track, Race? RACETRACK That hot tip I told you about? Nobody told the horse. They smile and continue into --
KLOPPMAN => You missed your supper, boys.
RACETRACK => Then we didn't miss much, did we?                     * 
JONATHAN => Actual income, as well as projected income, against actual operating costs, as well as projected operating costs, produce a reduced marginality of profit which in turn --
PULITZER => Seitz!   What in blazes is he talking about?
SEITZ => Says you need to make more money, Chief. 
PULITZER => Then Hearst undersells me and I'm in the poorhouse. Brilliant.
JONATHAN => Not the customer price -- the price to the distribution apparatus. Exasperated, Pulitzer looks to Seitz for a translation. SEITZ You mean the Newsies...? Charge the Newsies more for their papers? Bad idea, Chief. JONATHAN Very well. My next proposal -- salary cuts, particularly those at the very top -- PULITZER Wait. What  do the Newsies pay now -- fifty cents per hundred papers? If  you raised it to sixty cents --
JONATHAN => A mere tenth of a cent per paper --
PULITZER => -- then that, multiplied by forty thousand papers a day, seven days a week -- well, it would pay some of the bills around here.
SEITZ => Chief, if you do this, every Newsie we got will head straight for Hearst.
SEITZ => What about the other papers -- ? PULITZER If we do it, they'll all do it. It's only a tenth of a cent -- nobody gets hurt! It's good for the Newsies -- an incentive, make 'em work harder, sell more papers! Now get me Hearst on that contraption. Seitz sighs and reaches for the phone.
KID BLINK => They jacked up the price! Ten cents a hunnerd -- I can eat two                                   * days on ten cents!                                                 *

JACK => Awright, pipe down! Don't you see it's a gag? Just Weasel bein' a weasel. Joke's over, Wease. Gimme a hunnerd. He plops fifty cents on the counter.      Weasel's grin gets weaselier as he slides it back.
WEASEL => Hunnerd'll cost ya sixty, Cowboy. JACK I ain't payin' no sixty -- WEASEL Then move outta the way -- JACK You bet -- I move right over to the Journal.
RACETRACK => It's the same at the Journal -- we checked -- it's the same everywhere! JACK Why the jack-up, Weasel? WEASEL Why not? It's a nice day. Why don't you ast Mr. Pulitzer? He whacks the bell with his cudgel; the Delanceys stir threateningly. WEASEL If you ain't buyin' papes, clear out! World employees only on this sida the gates. JACK It stinks here anyway -- let's go!
KID BLINK => They can't do that to us -- RACETRACK They can do what they want -- it's their stinkin' paper -- BOOTS Ain't we got no rights -- ?
CRUTCHY => Sure -- we got the right to take it in the t'roat!
RACETRACK => It's a rigged deck -- why waste time kiddin' ourselves? They set the price, we gotta pay it -- MUSH We got no choice! So let's get our lousy papes while they still got some -- JACK Nobody's goin' anywhere -- they ain't gonna get away with this! EVERYBODY What can we do --
LES => Stop crowding him!    Let him think!
RACETRACK =>  Jack...? Ya still thinkin'... ?                        * Jack looks at him, then the others:    his jaw set.
JACK => One thing for sure. If we don't sell papes, then nobody sells papes. Nobody comes through those gates 'til they put the price back where it was. 
JACK => Yeah, a strike -- good idea, Dave.
DAVID =>  No, I didn't mean -- we can't strike, we're not a union --
JACK => We go on strike, we're a union, right? Keep it comin', Dave --
DAVID =>  There's not enough of us -- maybe if we got every Newsie in New York -- JACK Yeah, we organize -- we get all the New York Newsies to join us! This is great, Dave, keep talkin' -- DAVID It's no joke! You saw what happened to those trolley workers -- JACK Another great idea! Any Newsie don't join with us, we soak 'im -- just like the trolley workers!
DAVID => Nooo! Stop and think, willya?     You can't just rush everybody into this!
JACK => Dave's right again! We gotta think this through! Old man Pulitzer and Hearst and all them other rich geezers, they run this city. Do we really think a buncha streetrats like us would have a chance against people like them? 
LES => Strike!
BOOTS => Keep talkin', Jack -- tell us what to do --
DAVID => Uh... uh... Pulitzer and Hearst have to respect our rights -- JACK Pulitzer and Hearst have to respect the workin' boys of New York!  Keep it comin' -- what else.
DAVID => Uh... they can't treat us like we don't exist... SONG:   "THE WORLD WILL KNOW"   APPROXIMATE TIME: 3:30. JACK PULITZER AND HEARST THEY THINK WE'RE NOTHING ARE WE NOTHING? NEWSIE NO! DAVID If we stick together like the trolley workers, they can't break us up. JACK PULITZER AND HEARST THEY THINK THEY GOT US DO THEY GOT US? NEWSIES NO! 
BOOTS => What's to stop someone else from sellin' our papes?
JACK => We talk to 'em. RACETRACK Some of 'em don't hear so good. JACK Then we soak 'em.
DAVID => No! JACK WHAT'S IT GONNA TAKE TO STOP THE WAGONS? ARE WE READY? NEWSIES YEAH! DAVID No! We can't beat up kids in the street! It'll destroy what we're trying to do! JACK WHAT'S IT GONNA TAKE Jack's not listening now.          TO STOP THE SCABBERS? CAN WE DO IT?

The Newsies answer back.                    ALL PULITZER MAY CRACK THE WHIP BUT HE WON'T WHIP US! Crossing the square, as                       ALL they move towards the gates,   AND   THE WORLD WILL KNOW singing up to Pulitzer's       AND   THE WORLD WILL LEARN office in the dome at the      AND   THE WORLD WILL WONDER top of The World Building.     HOW   WE MADE THE TABLES TURN

JACK => We gotta get word out to all the                            * Newsies in New York! I gotta have                           * some... whattaya call 'em -- DAVID Ambassadors. JACK Right! You guys gotta be embastards and tell 'em we're on strike! KID BLINK I'll take Harlem! RACETRACK I got mid-town!        CRUTCHY The Bronx!                MUSH I'll get da Bowery!
JACK => Bumlet, Specs, Skittery take Queens; Pie Eater and Snotty, the East side -- Snipeshooter, go with 'em; okay, who wants Brooklyn? Spot Conlon's territory?
to do. => JACK Whatsamatter?    Scared of Brooklyn?
DAVID => Sure. Right after you take our demands to Pulitzer. JACK  Me? (looks up at the dome) To Pulitzer? DAVID  You're the leader.
JACK => Maybe the kid'll soften him up a little.
DENTON => What's going on? DAVID They're going in to present our demands to Pulitzer. DENTON What demands? 
DENTON => I'm Denton, New York Sun.   What's your name?
DAVID =>  David...
DENTON => David.  As in David and Goliath?  You really think old man Pulitzer's going to listen to your demands? DAVID He has to.
JACK =>  So's your ol' lady! Tell Pulitzer he needs an appointment with me! The doors slam shut; Denton scribbles, intrigued.
JACK =>  -- So this snooty mug is sayin', 'You cawn't see Mr. Pulitzer, no one sees Mr. Pulitzer' -- real hoity-toity, you know the type -- LES  Real hoity-toity --
LES => That's when they threw us out. DENTON Doesn't it scare you going up against the most powerful man in New York? JACK  Yeah, lookit me, I'm tremblin'. Denton smiles, closes his notebook.    Gets up, handing David a card. DENTON Keep me informed -- I want to know everything that happens. DAVID Are we really an important story...? DENTON What's important? A year ago I covered the war in Cuba -- charging up San Juan Hill with Colonel Teddy Roosevelt. A very important story. Now it doesn't seem so important -- except Teddy's our governor and probably on his way to the White House. Is the Newsies' strike important? It all depends on you. JACK  My name really gonna be in the papers? DENTON Any objections?
JACK => Not as long as you get it right -- Kelly, Jack Kelly. And, Denton? No pictures.
BOOTS => Spent a month there one night.
DAVID => This Spot Conlon... is he really as bad as they say...?
DAVID => I say something funny? Come on, tell me -- he bad or not? What's the joke? Tell me, willya? We KEEP WIDENING as the figures get smaller and Jack and Boots keep laughing and David keeps asking about Spot...
CONLON. => SPOT If it ain't Jack be nimble, Jack be quick.
JACK => You're movin' up in the world, Spot -- got a ocean view and everything. Spot and Jack exchange "heh-hehs."   David's getting more nervous.
SPOT => So I'm hearin' things from little birdies in Harlem and Queens and all over. They're chirpin' in my ear: 'Jackie-boy's Newsies are playin' like they're goin' on strike -- '
DAVID =>  We're not playing -- we are on strike -- it's --
SPOT => What's this, Jackie boy?   Some kind of walkin' mouth? 
jackals. => DAVID Uh... we started the strike but... we can't do it alone, so... we've been talkin' to Newsies all over the city...
SPOT => So they told me. And what did they tell you? David looks nervously at the circling henchmen. DAVID That... they're all waiting to see what Spot Conlon does. That you're the key... (as Spot puffs himself up; David sees an opening) That Spot Conlon is the most respected and... famous... newsie in New York... and probably everywhere else...
DAVID => And... if Spot Conlon joins the strike, they'll join and we'll be unstoppable so you gotta join and ... well... you gotta... He trails off.    Spot nods, turns to Jack.
SPOT => You're right. Brains.  But I got brains, too -- and more than half-a-one. How do I know you punks won't run the first time some goon comes atcha with a club? How do I know you're in it to win?
SPOT => Not good enough, Jackie-boy.   You gotta show me.
JACK => Maybe you lost your guts, Spotty- boy --  -- or maybe you traded 'em to some chicken for that beak of yours.  Maybe you gotta show me you ain't afraid to join the strike. Murder's in the air: David and Boots are paralyzed; the henchmen are ready to explode. Spot's eyes are locked on Jack's for an excruciating moment -- then Spot grins. SPOT Nice try, pal. But that's just what I'm talkin' about.  Show me this strike ain't just some kids do-or-dare, then we'll talk.
RACETRACK => So where's Spot Conlon?
KID BLINK => Without Spot and the others, there ain't enough of us... MUSH Maybe we're movin' too soon, maybe we ain't ready -- SKITTERY Definitely should put this off a coupla days, definitely -- PIE EATER Hey, Jack -- you ready?   I'm ready! He's swinging a picket sign.
JACK => At least somebody's got the right idea. PIE EATER Who else is ready for stick-ball? He tears the sign off the stick and swings it like a bat. JACK Who we kiddin' here. Spot was right. Just a game to these guys...
CRUTCHY => Hey, Jack -- get a loada this!
sing => 
DAVID => OPEN THE GATES AND SEIZE THE DAY As David sings,                 DON'T BE AFRAID AND DON'T DELAY the others join in.             NOTHING CAN BREAK US They stand waiting,             NO ONE CAN MAKE US arms interlocked, as            GIVE OUR RIGHTS AWAY the gates begin to              ARISE AND SEIZE THE DAY         * open...

clubs... => -- Jack signals and Boots, Race and the boys loose a volley of rotten fruit -- With a shrill cry, the Newsies         * rush into the courtyard and leap onto the wagons --              * Denton watches nearby, writing it all down. David moves among the ranks of terrified non-striking Newsies, exhorting them -- DAVID Throw down your papers!   Join the strike!
WHISTLES -- => 
SEITZ => I don't think they're just going to go away, Chief. WEASEL Just give me the means, Mr. Pulitzer. I'll take care of them for you. Pulitzer turns his godlike gaze on Weasel, who seems to shrink slightly. Pulitzer studies him a moment. PULITZER  Give him whatever 'means' he requires, I want this nuisance over and done with.
JACK => The House of Refuge... my home- sweet-home... 
DAVID => How can you be sure they sent Crutchy here?
TENPIN => Cowboy!   Ya miss the joint?
JACK => Whattayasay, Tenpin.   You got a new guy, Crutchy --
TENPIN => The gimp?   I'll get him for ya.
JACK => That's Tenpin -- s'posed to get out last Christmas but Snyder keeps tackin' more time on his sentence --
DAVID =>  Be quiet -- they'll hear you --!
CRUTCHY => Hey, whattaya hangin' around here for? That Dave up there? Hiya, Dave!
JACK => Go get your hat, Crutch -- kiss Snyder good-bye. CRUTCHY  Yeah... hey, shoulda seen me in court today -- old Judge Movealong Monahan hisself! Took him two minutes to move me along to Snyder for 'my own good.' JACK Later, Crutchy -- get your stuff. Crutchy stops Jack's hand prying at the bars. CRUTCHY Listen, Jack... truth is, I ain't walkin' so good. Oscar and Morris kinda worked me over a little... JACK They hurt you...? Don't worry, we'll carry you -- CRUTCHY  I don't want nobody carryin' me -- never!
DAVID => You mean it's true --? Crutchy hears something and quickly shushes them: Jack disappears from the window; Crutchy slumps into a bunk and pretends to sleep -- just as Snyder comes into the room. Utter silence --
JACK => Crutchy won't last in there... I seen stronger guys than him not make it.
DAVID => What was he doing at the Refuge? JACK Runnin' for governor. Showin' his concern, like all pols during elections.
DAVID => Teddy's not like other politicians. He's the biggest hero in the country. JACK Anyway, he's there. I see his fancy coach waitin' for 'im, so I sneaks on top of it. Teddy gets in and he's wavin' goodbye, and all the guys are wavin' goodbye, and Snyder's wavin' -- 'Good-byeeee, Colonel Roosevelt!' So just as we're goin' out the gate, I stands up and --  'Good-byeee, Warden Snyder!' It was in the papes and everything. DAVID  He's governor now. I don't understand how he could see that place and not do anything -- JACK He only seen what Snyder wanted him to -- good food, everything the city pays for that Snyder usually steals.
DAVID => I'll bet if he just knew -- I mean, he's a hero -- JACK Last year he was a hero.   This year he's a politician.
WEASEL => Okay, 'newsies' -- you check the funny papers this morning?
the gates. => THE NEWSIES OPEN THE GATES AND SEIZE THE DAY DON'T BE AFRAID AND DON'T DELAY NOTHING CAN BREAK US NO ONE CAN MAKE US GIVE OUR RIGHTS AWAY ARISE AND SEIZE THE DAY!
DAVID => Join us!   Join us! etc. Some of the scabs decide fast -- they throw down their papers and run to the Newsies where they're welcomed with cheers and handshakes -- but then -- JACK  Look out -- ! A WAGON is ROARING out of the gates full-speed -- barrel-          * ling towards the line of Newsies --                                *
DENTON => Why don't you stop this -- ? COP (looks at him coldly) You better move along, mister... Denton turns, picks up something -- a large camera and tripod. He moves off quickly --
WEASEL => Strike's over, boys. Something seems to sting him in the neck -- he slaps at it as if at a mosquito. Then other Thugs begin slapping -- all over the square, Thugs are slapping and looking around in puzzlement -- then -- -- the BELL CLANGS as it's hit by a good-sized stone.
where -- => -- It's Brooklyn to the rescue: Spot Conlon's gang is pelting the Thugs with volleys from their slingshots -- and Spot himself is swinging through the air on a chain hoist into the square. He grins as Jack runs up --
SPOT => So, ya showed me! Now I'll show you what Brooklyn can do --! The Thugs retreat from the merciless slingshots -- Jack rallies his Newsies and leads a screaming charge as the Thugs hurry behind the gates, closing them. Jack and Spot spit in their palms, shake hands as -- 
SKITTERY => NOW IS THE TIME TO Jack leaps on a loose horse, pulls David up                      ALL and they lead an impromptu    SEIZE THE DAY victory parade. RACETRACK The police fade away;         SEND OUT THE CALL AND Spectators who have watched it all begin to                    ALL applaud. Many throw           SEIZE THE DAY coins, bills, or show other signs of support...                        BUMLETS WRONGS WILL BE RIGHTED ALL SEIZE THE DAY PIE EATER WHEN WE'RE UNITED

out -- => 
Loud cheers. => MUSH Hey, ya write sweet, Denton -- real sweet. Denton smiles; Jack is in the center, trying to keep cool.
DAVID =>  'Their leader is a child of the New York streets with a red bandana and a golden tongue, Jack Kelly -- ' JACK Where's it say that...?
SPOT => Stop t'inkin' about yaself and let 'im read!
DENTON => -- They can just ignore you until you go away. JACK We ain't goin' away.   We'll never go away. DAVID That's what we gotta show 'em -- we gotta do somethin' they can't ignore, somethin' big -- JACK We'll do it up big, all right -- We'll show 'em we ain't tired, or                      * bored, and the hungrier we get, the more we fight -- (as Denton starts writing) We'll have a rally -- every Newsie                     * in New York -- and we're gonna send                    * a message: there's a lot of us and we ain't goin' away -- we'll keep fightin' until doomsday if it means gettin' what's ours!
CRUTCHY => That's Jack -- ! Hey, he looks just like hisself! Snyder looks at the picture:    instant recognition.
SNYDER => You know this boy...? CRUTCHY Him?   Nah.
SNYDER =>  You have a famous friend, this 'Jack.'... Do you know where he lives...? CRUTCHY I never seen the guy, honest. (hits his head with his palm) This brain of mine, always makin' mistakes. Got a mind of its own. He hobbles out quickly.    Snyder looks at him, eyes narrowing.
MEDDA => Darlings, I love you -- I wish                            * you luck on your rally, I am behind                       * you one hundred percent. But I'm not running a union hall here -- this is a theater, a temple of art. And well-known money pit.
JACK => We got money, Medda.      Some, anyway. 
DAVID => We'll take a collection at the door. We'll pay whatever you ask.
MEDDA => It's not the money. I depend on the papers. They write good things about me, the customers flock here like sheep. They give me the pan, I'm the one who gets sheared. DAVID You're afraid of them, too...
JACK => Medda's gotta look out for herself same as anybody. We'll find another place. DAVID How can they make a whole city afraid? We're the ones putting our necks on the line -- all we need is for somebody to have the guts to stand up and show them we're not alone! MEDDA They have the power to destroy people...
DAVID => They can't destroy you if you fight them -- only if you let them own you! MEDDA  You are so young... She looks back out at the stage; Jack pulls David away. Then --
MEDDA => Got to be on Monday night.   I'm dark on Monday nights.
MEDDA => Don't thank me. Thank Mr. Wisenheimer Guilt-maker of 1899 there.
KLOPPMAN => Can I help you? The figure turns -- Snyder smiles his smarmy smile.
SNYDER => Do you have a 'Jack Kelly' registered here? I wish to see him.
sight. => KLOPPMAN 'Jack Kelly...?' Any of you boys know a 'Jack Kelly'?
SNIPESHOOTER => Unusual name for these parts.                  SKITTERY I knew a Jack somebody once. Prob'ly not the same guy. RACETRACK You mean Jack Kelly -- ? Behind Snyder, they see Jack bouncing in the front door. Racetrack tries to signal him -- RACETRACK -- He was here but he put an egg in his shoe and beat it. Jack sees Snyder -- but instead of running back out the door, he can't resist mocking him behind his back. The Newsies snicker; Kloppman is dying. SNYDER I have reason to believe he's an escaped prisoner. Possibly dangerous. KLOPPMAN Oh, dear me... dangerous? My files are in the rear -- this way, please. 
RACETRACK =>  Give to the Newsies strike fund, mista?
shivering. => SARAH  Did you sleep there?    Why didn't you wake us up?
JACK => Didn't wanna disturb nobody... anyway, it's like the Waldorf out here... great view, cool air --
SARAH => Go up on the roof.
SARAH => It's all getting so big. The family's very worried about the boys. And you, too.
JACK => Your mom and pop are worried about me...?
SARAH =>  The whole family...
SARAH => David says you're moving away when the strike's over. To Santa Fe. I've never been out of the city.
JACK =>  You'd like it out there -- they got this big yellow desert and the air's real blue, see, from the sky, and the sun, it's bigger out there. SARAH  It's the same sun as here. JACK No.  No, it ain't...  Not that I been there or nothin'. SARAH Guess your parents wrote you about it. Bet you can't wait to see them again.
JACK =>  Sure... big family reunion. Soon's I get the dough for train fare.
SARAH => David said you spent all your money to rent the theater.
JACK => Not that I blame you -- me bein' such an interestin' guy and all --
SARAH =>  Are you...?
JACK => What'd I tell ya -- interestin', right? Sarah giggles.       The leaflet gyrates in the wind as we GO TO --
PULITZER => A fugitive from one of your prisons, Mayor -- a convicted thief who's been at large for some time under the alias of 'Jack Kelly.' His real name is...?
company. => SNYDER Sullivan, Your Honor -- Francis Sullivan. I would have caught him before now but -- PULITZER You know Warden Snyder, don't you, Mayor? I believe you appointed him. The Mayor nods ruefully; not one of his best appoint- ments. MAYOR If this boy is a fugitive, then the chief can quietly arrest him and -- PULITZER Not quietly -- I want an example made. I want this rabble he's roused to see what happens to those who dare to -- well, they should see justice in action. MAYOR Arrest him at the rally?   But...
PULITZER => By the way, Mayor, I'm having a few friends for cards that night -- newspaper friends, Willie Hearst, Gordon Bennett. Perhaps you'll join us -- we can talk about the coming election. 
MAYOR => Chief, when you arrest this Kelly, you'd better go in force -- in case some of his misguided friends should start any trouble. As they go, Pulitzer picks up his magnifying glass and examines the leaflet. We CUT AWAY as he stares through the glass so he seems to be looking at --
BOOTS => Extry, extry -- Newsies take Noo Yawk! Swarms of excited Newsies engulf Boots as     he pretends to hawk the imaginary headline. They cascade      toward the entrance where Jack and David shake hands,     slap backs as they flow past. Kloppman goes past, then      Denton. Sarah and Les are nearby.
JACK => Hey, Denton -- sit down front! You're the guest of honor!
DENTON =>  I'm working press tonight.  The only working press. As usual.
DAVID => As long as you keep writing about us, they're gonna know we exist.
PULITZER => You know the boys, Mayor -- Mr. Bennett of The Tribune, Mr. Taylor of The Times, of course you know Mr. Hearst -- and this is a new member of our little group, Mr. Gammon, who just came back from Europe...
hand. => PULITZER                                * Mr. Gammon owns The New York Sun.                     * They all light cigars as Pulitzer begins to deal.
JACK => Carryin' the banner! AUDIENCE  Carryin' the banner! The noise threatens to blow the roof off the theater as we see --
JACK => We come a long way but we ain't there yet -- and maybe it's only gonna get tougher from now on! That means we get tougher too -- (as a huge roar goes up) -- it also means we get smarter! That's why we're gonna listen to my pal David and stop soakin' the scabs -- SEVERAL IN CROWD No!    They asked for it -- etc.
RACETRACK => Whatta we s'pose to do -- kiss 'em? JACK I personally wouldn't go that far, Race. SPOT  Any scab I see, I soak 'em -- period! DAVID That's just what they want you to do -- so they can say we're just thugs -- SPOT I don't care what they say -- some of us ain't made to just take it! I say anybody hurts us, we hurts them worst! Who's with me?
as -- => BY ENTRANCE DOORS
him. => 
JACK => That's right -- start fightin' each other! Prove what the big shots say is true -- we're street rats with no brains and no respect for nothin' -- includin' ourselves!  Here's how it is: we don't stick together, we're nothin'. We don't trust each other, we're nothin'. We don't act together, we're nothin' -- and we might as well go back to the streets where we belong. What's it gonna be?  Whattaya say, Spot? SPOT I say --
SPOT => I say... what you say... I say! Spits in his palm and they shake. A huge roar goes up and the boys thrust their hands up in triumph -- but the applause isn't for them but for the curtain rising behind them revealing the dazzling vision of Medda, who walks smiling downstage and begins -- 
MEDDA => Hiya, Newsies -- what's new? They roar; Racetrack's on his feet -- RACETRACK Hey, Medda, anytime you're off to the races, remember -- I got all the winners! MEDDA You're all winners here tonight, Racetrack. Just being with you makes me feel kinda extra extra. MUSH  I'm dead, I'm in Heaven -- somebody gimme a harp! MEDDA But you never know what life will bring. Over the years, I've developed quite an outlook --
KID BLINK => Oooo, lookout for that outlook! MEDDA And all kinds of people are always asking my advice, well, for instance -- 
EVERYBODY! => ALL HIGH TIMES, HARD TIMES SOMETIMES THE LIVIN' IS SWEET AND SOMETIMES THERE'S NOTHIN' TO EAT BUT I ALWAYS LANDS ON MY FEET SO WHEN THERE'S DRY TIMES I WAIT FOR HIGH TIMES AND THEN I PUTS ON MY BEST AND I STICKS OUT MY CHEST AND I'M OFF TO THE RACES AGAIN Medda moves through the crowd: MEDDA You boys sing as sweet as songbirds.
MUSH => Lookit me, I'm a bird, I'm flyin', I'm flyin' --
KID BLINK => It's a beautiful, Medda, I tellya, I never heard such beautiful!
BOOTS =>  My prettiest one, Medda -- it's like your eyes. MEDDA  Thank you, Boots. Would you keep it for me? For luck? Boots beams happily as she moves to --
MEDDA => I'm afraid so, Race...
MEDDA =>  SO YOUR OLD LADY DON'T LOVE YOU NO MORE SO YOU'RE AFRAID THERE'S A WOLF AT YOUR DOOR SO YOU GOT STREET RATS WHAT SCREAMS IN YOUR EAR The boys boo and hiss.
MEDDA => YOU WIN SOME, YOU LOSE SOME, MY DEAR ALL IT'S HIGH TIMES, HARD TIMES SOMETIMES THE LIVIN' IS SWEET AND SOMETIMES THERE'S NOTHIN' TO EAT BUT I ALWAYS LANDS ON MY FEET SO WHEN THERE'S DRY TIMES I WAIT FOR HIGH TIMES AND THEN I PUTS ON MY BEST AND I STICKS OUT MY CHEST AND I'M OFF TO THE RACES AGAIN I PUTS ON MY BEST AND I STICKS OUT MY CHEST AND I'M OFF TO THE RACES AGAIN!
DENTON => Aren't you Warden Snyder? Snyder nearly swallows the whistle --
DENTON => I'm Denton of The Sun. I've heard about your work with young people. I wonder if you'd agree to an interview? Snyder blinks at him, glances at his watch, then lowers his police whistle, smiling modestly.
ON STAGE => David tries to move to Jack to warn him but Race and the others have formed a chorus line and drag him into it. David shouts over the song -- DAVID Jack -- you've gotta get out of here! Snyder! (as Jack cups his ear) Snyder!
DENTON =>  Is it Snyder as in 'snide'? Furious, Snyder blows the police whistle for all he's worth. Instantly police burst in from every door -- all converging on Jack. Immediately he leaps off the stage into the arms of several boys below -- then fights his way out the front door --
WEASEL => Show's over, Cowboy. He turns to see Weasel and   the Delanceys grinning at him, clubs in their hands. They    start toward him and suddenly disappear -- straight down   the trap door that's suddenly opened beneath their feet.    Jack sees Spot at a lever in the wings -- RACETRACK Curtain goin' up, Jack -- !
BOOTS => Try to reach the skylight -- ! Cops leap for Jack's legs as he rises above them heading up into the flies. He hangs on, thrusts one fist into the air and shouts -- JACK Carryin' the banner!
MEDDA =>  Unhand that boy this instant! (as MacSwain looks up, startled) I said hands off the kid, you red- faced baboon! Get out of my theater -- out, out, out, out, out! David twists away as MacSwain backs stumblingly down the stairs as Medda descends on him in full fury. MEDDA If you're tired of beating up children, maybe you'd like to try a lady next. Confused and intimidated, the Irish cop looks at her -- then ducks his head shamefacedly and moves away.
MEDDA => Run, David, hurry --
DAVID => They got Jack -- MEDDA You can't help him if you're in jail, too! You were right, David -- you've got to keep fighting them -- always.  Now go. Please. David looks at her, very moved, then goes. She turns back to her theater -- the sounds of the melee sweep over her. She watches, tears welling in her eyes...
BAILIFF => Awrise, awrise, court is now in session, Judge E.A. Monahan presiding.
MONAHAN => Any of you represented by counsel? No? Good. That'll move things along considerably. David sees Denton come in, a neat bandage on his head. SPOT Judge Movealong, ya honor, I object. MONAHAN On what grounds? SPOT  On the grounds of Brooklyn, ya honor! The Newsies congratulate Spot.    Monahan gavels. MONAHAN I fine you each five dollars or two weeks confinement in -- RACETRACK Five bucks!   We ain't got five cents! DENTON  I'll pay the fines. All of them. JUDGE Pay the clerk. Next.
ALL                                      * => Thanks, I owe ya, you're a right                       * guy, Denton, etc.                                      * 
SNYDER => This boy's real name is Francis Sullivan; mother deceased; father a convict in the state penitentiary --
SNYDER => He is currently an escapee from the House of Refuge, where his original sentence of three months for theft was extended six months for disruptive behavior --
JACK => -- Like demandin' you give us the food you steal from us -- SNYDER -- Followed by an additional six months for an attempted escape -- JACK  -- Last time wasn't no attempt, remember, Snyder? Me and Teddy Roosevelt wavin' bye-bye -- SNYDER -- Therefore, I ask that he be returned to the House of Refuge -- JACK -- For my own good, right, Movealong? -- and for what Snyder kicks back to ya -- SNYDER -- And that the court order his incarceration until the age of twenty-one --
DAVID/NEWSIES                       SNYDER => -- In the hope that we No! You can't do that!              may yet guide him to a No! Etc.                            useful and productive life.
MONAHAN => So ordered.   Next.
KID BLINK => He won't be there long -- the jail ain't built that Jack can't bust outta. BOOTS They're buildin' some mighty good jails these days... RACETRACK So where's Denton? DAVID He said he'd be here.  We can't let this stop us. We gotta keep the strike going, just like Jack was here. MUSH  Yeah, but Jack ain't here. RACETRACK We know that, genius -- if he was here, he'd be tellin' us what to do when he ain't here.
SPOT =>  You bummers is givin' me a headache.
DAVID => Where you goin'? We need you.
SPOT => Nachally  Spot Conlon is needed wherever  -- which right now is Brooklyn.   Some of my boys is worried,  I must give ear to their concerns  -- 
DENTON => Because it never happened.
DAVID/ALL => Never happened; whattaya mean?   Etc. 
DAVID => Denton, what's happened -- you get fired or somethin'?
DENTON => Reassigned -- back to my old job as The Sun's ace war correspondent. The owner thinks I should be covering only the 'really important' stories. So wish me luck, boys. At least half what I wish you.  They don't always fire you, David. He moves off; David, stunned, hurries after him. DAVID They bought you off... didn't they? Didn't they!
DENTON => They could've blackballed me from every paper in the country. I'm a newspaperman, I have to have a paper to write for. He looks at David; hurt, betrayed, angry; wishes there was more he could say. He hands him something from his coat. DENTON This is the story I wrote about the rally. I want you to read it at least. He hands it to David and   goes. David returns to the others, angrily crumpling   the story and hurling it onto the table. The boys look    puzzled; Les, still eating the sausage, picks up the   story and looks at it curiously.
DAVID => That's where we saw Crutchy... He starts to throw up the rope when Boots hisses from the corner, beckoning furiously. They hurry over and peek around the corner to see --
MUSH => Where they takin' him...? DAVID One way to find out.   Meet me back at the square! David runs after the carriage, leaping onto its back. He flashes the high-sign to the boys as the carriage moves off into the night. 121    OMITTED                                                       121 &                                                                    & 122                                                                  122
JACK => Very impressive. So where do they keep the trains in this station? Seitz shows   him into an elegant library. Snyder tries to follow but   Seitz stops him, closing the doors. Inside, Jack looks   around to see the imposing figure of Pulitzer staring at   him, framed by luxurious furnishings. For a moment, the   two just stare at each other. Then --
JACK =>  Sorry to see you ain't doin' so good, Joe.                                             *
great events... => 
PULITZER => People think wars are about right and wrong. They're not. They're about power. You know what power is? JACK Heard of that, too.   I don't just sell ya papes, Joe.   Sometimes I read 'em. Pulitzer ignores the impudence, continues quietly. PULITZER Power means that I could see to it that you serve your full sentence at the Refuge. Or I could pull strings and have you free tomorrow. It means I could give you my pocket change -- and you'd have more money than you'd likely ever earn. JACK You bribin' me, Joe? Thanks for the compliment, but I ain't got the power to stop the strike -- PULITZER I disagree. You're the spirit of the strike, without you, they'd fall apart in a few days.
JACK => Ring for my coach, willya?   It's past my bedtime --
PULITZER => Shut your mouth and listen ! (as Jack looks up, startled) You're going to do exactly as I say --
JACK => I told ya... I can't call off the strike.
PULITZER => I'm not asking you to. All I ask is that you return to your old job -- as Newsie for the The World. JACK And be a scab? Forget it -- PULITZER For a few days. Then the strike ends -- and it will end, boy, make no mistake -- and you can go wherever you want to buy a ticket. Free and clear, with money in your pocket... and no one chasing you. Jack is silent, troubled.    Pulitzer pushes a buzzer. PULITZER You go back to the Refuge. Think it over in your cell. Let me know in the morning.
DAVID => Jack! 
DAVID => Why're you stoppin' -- we've got to run! JACK You shouldn't'a done this, David. They could put you in jail -- DAVID It's worth it -- let's go --
JACK => You go to jail, what happens to your family? You don't know nothin' about jail! Thanks for what you done, but you gotta get outta here --
DAVID => I don't understand -- JACK I don't either -- I don't understand nothin' no more! Jack pushes David down the street.
JACK => Just go! 
CUT TO => 128B   INT. HOUSE OF REFUGE                                           128B
JACK => SANTA FE MY OLD FRIEND I CAN'T SPEND MY WHOLE LIFE HIDIN' YOU'RE THE ONLY LIGHT THAT'S GUIDIN' ME TODAY Jack looks up as the serving panel opens and Crutchy peers through, offering him something furtively: a boiled potato. CRUTCHY Snitched it offa Snyder's plate when I was servin' him -- the biggest one! (as Jack shakes his head, looks away) Snyder was eatin' good tonight -- the stuff we don't never get?                            * Patatas... olives...  ... liver and bacon. Sauerkraut...  Guess what I done to his sauerkraut.
JACK =>  So what's it git'cha?
CRUTCHY => Anudder three months, prob'ly. But you can't let 'em beat'cha, right, Jack?
JACK => We was beat when we was born. Crutchy, concerned, hears something and closes the panel.
DAVID => Nobody sells a pape today -- we're hurtin' them and they know it! Remember -- no soakin', no hittin' -- etc.
SPOT => Look... I'm seein' t'ings... tell me I'm seeing t'ings -- ! David and the others look in disbelief -- walking with the scabs is Jack, wearing a tight new suit, flanked by Weasel and other goons. As Jack moves past, staring straight ahead, the chant dies...
RACETRACK => What's he doin' with the scabs...? KID BLINK It ain't happenin'... it can't be happenin'... MUSH Hey, Jack -- it's me, Mush, lookit me -- look, willya?
BOOTS => Where'd he get them clothes -- ?
WEASEL =>  Mr. Pulitzer picked 'em out hisself. A special gift to a special new employee. Only not so new, huh, cowboy? SPOT He sold us out! Ya dirty scab, I'll murder ya -- !
along -- => 
WEASEL => I'm gonna be lookin' for you, wiseguy --  -- or maybe you'd like a nice new suit of your own.
DAVID => Keep after them -- we don't need him!  Stop The World -- don't scab! Etc. Some chant halfheartedly, confused, demoralized. A few toss down their picket signs in disgust. David moves among them, desperately trying to keep the chant going. The scabs move on, passing Les, who gives Jack a stricken look as he moves away.
LES =>  He's just foolin' 'em... so he can spy on them or something...  That's it. He's spyin' on 'em. He's gotta be.
ESTHER => That hand is not ready to work.
long. => 
SARAH =>  What is this?
LES => Hey -- I'm saving that!
MAYER =>  Don't be too hard on your friend. Maybe he had his reasons for doing what he did. LES  I told you. He's spyin' on 'em.
MAYER => There.   You see? Mayer smiles and goes.     Sarah moves to David with the stained papers. SARAH It's Denton's story. 'The Dark Truth: Why Our City Really Fears the Newsie Strike, by Bryan Denton. Last night I saw naked force exercised against mere boys, the Newsies, who earn at best a few pennies a day. I wondered why so much, against so little -- '
KLOPPMAN => He will only be a minute.   Please, no trouble.
RACETRACK => Dear me, what is dat unpleasant aroma -- ? (as Jack's fists clench) Go on, take a shot -- I bust your scab face, ya yellow-livered,                           * rotten stinkin' piecea garbage!                         *
WEASEL => You try any tricks, and I go straight to Mr. Pulitzer.  Will you be requirin' anything else? Then I bid you good night.
WEASEL => Sleep well, cowboy...? Jack ignores him, moves off with his papers. The Delanceys pass by; Morris grinning at him, bouncing a club in his hand. OSCAR Come wit' us, cowboy -- we're gonna fix your pal Davey today -- fix 'im so's he can't walk no more. MORRIS Shuddup!
SARAH => Les, come on -- you're supposed to be helping me today. LES  I'd rather be soakin' scabs.
OSCAR =>  'Scuse me, sweetface. She tries to step around him but Morris is there. He "accidentally" knocks her lacework into the gutter. Les sees it -- and races towards the Delanceys -- LES Get away from my sister!
MORRIS => Where's ya brudder, tootsie? Where's little Davey...?
SARAH =>  You... stupid... ape! On "ape," she socks him square in the grin -- he recoils, licking a bloody lip. Behind him, she sees David rounding the corner -- 
OSCAR => Yeah, run, Davey! We got the best parta ya family right here! David, furious, runs down the sidewalk towards them. Morris slips on some brass knuckles in anticipation. Sarah struggles, screaming -- SARAH David, no -- don't -- !
LES => Jack! Jack flashes him a grin        as he works on Morris's bread basket. Just as Oscar         frees himself from the derby, David leaps on him like        a fury. Punches fly and the Delanceys beat a quick        retreat down the sidewalk, yelling back --
MORRIS => Ya better run, cowboy -- we're tellin' Weasel! You'll be back in the Refuge by supper time!                                 OSCAR Yeah, run, ya lousy coward -- run! But they're the ones running. David, catching his breath, looks at Jack, beginning to understand. DAVID Couldn't stay away, huh.                                    *
JACK => Guess I can't be somethin' I ain't. DAVID A scab...?                                                  *
JACK => Nah.    Smart.                                              *
DAVID => Without you, the strike's falling apart...
JACK => I got no choice. I stay here, they lock me up 'til I'm twenty- one.
button shoes. => LES Jack, for the trip -- a pair of cowboy boots! Sorta. Mayer with a bundle of clothes; Esther with food come to the window. She gives it to Jack. ESTHER Who knows what's to eat where you're going? MAYER  A few things of mine and David's. Wish we had money to give you... JACK  Who needs it...? I go down to the train yards, hop me a freight, go in the best style -- free... MAYER I don't know what's waiting for you in Santa Fe, but you'll always have family here.
SARAH =>  You're not going to run away. They'll just come after you. You have to fight them.
SARAH => Denton's story. JACK Denton looked out for hisself just like I gotta do -- so save it. SARAH Just listen! 'The men who run this city are terrified of the Newsies strike -- because other child laborers in the factories and sweatshops are hearing the message of the Newsies leader --' LES That's you!   He's writin' about you!
SARAH => 'In the voice of Jack Kelly, these children hear strength and pride. Most of all, they hear hope...'
DENTON => ' -- And that is what terrifies the powers-that-be, for they know our city thrives on the shame of child labor. Therefore, Jack Kelly's voice must be stopped, whatever the cost...  Damn good writing, isn't it? 
JACK => All them sweatshop kids are listenin' to me...?
DAVID =>  What happened to the ace war correspondent? DENTON This war'll do for now.
SARAH => Whatever happens, it's Jack's decision. He's the one in danger. They look expectantly as he stares off, deep in thought. LES Jack...?   You thinkin'...? JACK Yeah... I'm thinkin' of Newsie Square full of kids...
DAVID =>  ... Another rally, right under Pulitzer's nose, and not just the Newsies -- JACK -- Every workin' kid from every sweatshop in New York. We gotta get the word out -- let's go get the Newsies --  They still think I'm a scab...
LES => I'll tell 'em you was a spy! 
JACK => Whattaya need to start a paper? Writers, right? So we got Denton. What else?
LES => Advertisements!  Cartoons? DENTON  A printing press. And no paper or printer is going to defy Pulitzer. The others look discouraged; Jack's thinking again.
JACK => Les. Go set me straight with the Newsies, okay? Tell 'em to meet us later at the World Building.
JACK => So happens I know a guy with a printing press.
JACK => They're  right above us -- and if Weasel  catches us, it won't be just me  they'll throw in the slammer  -- They can barely hear over the DIN of the PRESSES.
SARAH => What -- ? JACK I said shhhh! -- or we all go to jail! The others shush him hastily; MUSIC BEGINS as they go into --
as -- => MUSICAL NUMBER:   "THE POINT OF NO RETURN" BEGINS: DAVID WHAT'S THAT? JACK SHHH!    YOU'RE MAKIN' ME NERVOUS! DAVID SORRY. SARAH WATCH OUT!
DAVID => THERE'S SOMEBODY THERE.
SARAH => WHERE? JACK STAY CALM!
DAVID/SARAH => BUT -- 
JACK => DON'T YOU BUMMERS GET WHAT I'M SAYIN' THIS AIN'T HIDE AND SEEK THAT        * WE'RE PLAYIN' ONE FALSE STEP AND THEY'LL BE IN HERE ONE STRAY HAIR, THEY'LL KNOW WE BEEN HERE QUESTIONS -- IT'S TOO LATE FOR 'EM ANSWERS -- WE CAN'T WAIT FOR 'EM WE'RE AT THE POINT OF NO RETURN
DAVID => IS SOMEBODY COMING?
LES => NOT THAT I CAN SEE. David tosses some candles to Sarah; she lights them                    DAVID for Denton as he works.        NICE CATCH. SARAH THANKS. Jack finds a roll of newsprint.                                  JACK THAT OUGHTA GO THERE.                *
SARAH => BRING THOSE OVER. 
SARAH => TOO LOUD!   SOMEONE'S OVER US!
DENTON/JACK => RIGHT OR WRONG AIN'T WORTH A DAMN NOW! DAVID TOO LATE, GOTTA FINISH IT.
JACK/DENTON                         DAVID/SARAH => SOME THINGS                      SMART WE AIN'T ARE WORTH TRYING FOR SOME DREAMS                      MOM WOULD FAINT ARE WORTH DYING FOR EVERYBODY WE'RE AT THE POINT OF NO RETURN! LES                                 DAVID AND THE WORLD WILL KNOW          NOW WE HAVE TO WRITE A HEADLINE YOU GOTTA HAVE A HEADLINE JACK WHAT WE'VE COME TO SAY           DENTON OUGHTA DO IT HE KNOWS ABOUT THE HEADLINES AND THEY ALL REMEMBER US         SOMETHING REALLY FLASHY AND TALK ABOUT THE NIGHT         SO EVERYONE REMEMBERS AND DON'T FORGET TO PUT IN THERE WE SEIZED THE DAY                THAT KIDS FROM EVERYWHERE WILL BE AT NEWSIES' SQUARE During the above, Sarah holds a candle for Denton as he sets a headline in very large type: HOW WE CAN SHOW THIS CITY -- David has a better idea: he grabs some type and resets the headline: HOW WE CAN STOP THIS CITY. Meanwhile, Jack hits the switch and the PRESS HUMS to life. JACK/DENTON THEY'RE HITCHIN' ON A TROLLEY RIDIN' ON A WAGON STOWIN' ON THE FERRY COME TO SLAY THE DRAGON JACK/DENTON                         DAVID/SARAH HAILIN' FROM CANARSIE            SOFTER BENSONHURST AND CHELSEA          KEEP IT QUIET NOW ASTORIA AND BRIGHTON BEACH       FASTER LET ME TRY IT NOW
ALL => SHHHHHHH! (NOTE: During the above, several QUICK CUTS or DISSOLVES should give the impression that they've worked through the night:) A)   Lead type being rapidly hand-set by Denton, helped by David -- a sub-headline forms: "House of Refuge, House of Shame." B)   Papers -- "THE NEWSIE NEWS" -- start rolling off the press as they examine it proudly.
DAVID => The cops are looking for Jack -- we gotta protect him -- KID BLINK Any bull comes after jack, they gotta go through all of us. BOOTS What's with the bundle, Jack -- ya leavin'? JACK Sante Fe bound, Boots -- but not without givin' Pulitzer one last kiss goodbye -- KLOPPMAN Boys -- ! He points frantically at Weasel crossing the square towards them. They duck quickly -- and he weaves past whistling tunelessly, drunk. As Kloppman eases the wagon away, everybody looks back, shouts -- EVERYBODY Hey, Weasel... Good ni-ight!
EVERYBODY => WE'RE AT THE POINT OF NO RETURN! WE'RE AT THE POINT OF NO RETURN!
DENTON => I thought you'd feel that way, Governor Roosevelt. TEDDY ROOSEVELT Dis-graceful, Denty! Those poor boys -- and I did nothing!  Until now!
them. => MUSH So when's the others comin', Cowboy?
LES => WHEN THE CIRCULATION BELL STARTS RINGING, WILL WE HEAR IT?
LES => NO! NEWSIES WHEN YA GOT A MILLION VOICES More kids are appearing;        SINGING, WHO CAN HEAR A LOUSY messengers, garment girls,      WHISTLE BLOW? kids of all kinds -- ALL AND THE WORLD WILL KNOW! Kids are coming from everywhere, filling the   square -- Spot and the Brooklyn Newsies; more and more   kids, cheering, waving the Newsie News -- Jack and   David laugh in triumph as shouting and MUSIC RISES UP TO   -- ALL AND THE WORLD WILL FEEL THE FIRE AND FIN'LLY KNOW
PULITZER =>  Kelly's down there. He should be back in jail.
SEITZ =>  Those kids got out a pretty good paper, Chief. PULITZER Too good! Those illiterate guttersnipes couldn't have done this on their own. Somebody's behind this, trying to pull a fast one... JONATHAN Mr. Hearst on the line, sir. Wants to know if you've read the Newsies' paper? Pulitzer glowers in suspicion at the telephone. MAYOR I'm not taking the heat for this -- you've got to talk to them -- settle it --
PULITZER => Tell Hearst I'm busy!  I'll settle it all right -- once and for all.
SEITZ => It's time to talk. 
SEITZ => Then I guess you talk.
PULITZER => You're going to listen to me, boy -- JACK I'd like to, Joe -- (opens a window; crowd noise pours in) -- but I can't hear ya. PULITZER We had a deal -- you broke it. You're going back to jail. JACK Maybe. But you can't put every kid in that square in jail. They ain't goin' away, Joe. PULITZER Neither am I. I can wait them out. It won't be me that's hurt. JACK You sure about that?
JACK => It ain't about money, Dave -- if Joe gives in, that would mean nothin's like us got power. He can't let that happen -- no matter what it costs him. Right, Joe? PULITZER I'm about to show you what power really is... He slams the window shut; CROWD NOISE abruptly DROPS --
PULITZER => I have the police outside waiting to arrest you -- DAVID You lousy double-crossing -- ! PULITZER -- then I'll deal with that rabble in the street. He's crossing to a buzzer on his desk; Jack, thinking fast, snatches up a copy of the Newsies News.
JACK => Ya got me, Joe -- but tell me one thing, willya? How'd ya like our paper -- nice printin', ain't it? Right off the presses of one of New York's greatest newspapers --
PULITZER => All the papers have an agreement... we print nothing about the newsies. Whose press did you use? (as Jack shrugs, smiles) It was Hearst, wasn't it...!
PULITZER => I knew it. Whoever helped you print this lying rag is trying to break the strike, get the jump on the rest of us. Well, you're going to expose this backstabber to the other owners -- in exchange, I'll call off the police.
JACK => Not enough, Joe -- you gotta deal with our demands. Otherwise, our lips are sealed.
PULITZER =>  All right, all right -- just say the traitor's name. It's Hearst, isn't it? Say it! Say the name of the scoundrel whose press you used so I can make him the disgrace of the newspaper world! Say his name, damn you!
JACK => We just wanna say, 'Thanks, Joe.' (as he stares, stunned) And Hearst and them other owners? Maybe they don't have to know. Depends.
PULITZER => Perhaps we can resolve our... small differences. David digs out their demands and prepares to read.
RACE => We gotta warn Jack -- !
LES => Jack -- !   Jack -- !
WEASEL => I don't know how he got in here, Mr. Seitz -- but I'll take care of him, with pleasure. Just say the word!
SEITZ => With pleasure. You're fired. WEASEL Come again...? A tomato hits him in the face; he turns to see Les wiping tomato juice off his hands.
LES => He said, you're fired. Triumphant, Jack hoists Les over his shoulders:
JACK => The strike's over -- we beat 'em! 
LES =>  The bulls! Jack -- the bulls! Jack sees several police shoving through the crowd toward him. He quickly deposits Les -- turns to run and sees -- -- Snyder right in front of him, hands behind his back. Jack spins away and right into the arms of --
MacSWAIN => Easy, lad! You don't have to run anymore -- not from the likes of him anyway! Jack looks again and sees Snyder's hands are handcuffed behind him; two cops have him in custody. Denton is there, smiling. DENTON We brought the Warden over to say goodbye. Goodbye, Warden.
CRUTCHY =>  Remember what I told ya -- first t'ing ya do in jail, you make friends with the rats, share what you got in common --  Hiya, Jack! My leg tells me the strike's over! JACK  Crutchy -- I don't get it.   What happened -- ?
JACK => What're you talkin' about -- who come chargin' in?
CRUTCHY => Who?   Your pal! Him!
ELEGANT COACH => parked across the square. A Rough Rider opens the door and a man leans forward -- a glimpse of silk hat and walrus mustache as Teddy Roosevelt raises his walking stick in salute to Jack across the square.
JACK => Think he could drop me at the train yards?
JACK => It's now or never, Racetrack.
RACETRACK => Won't be the same without ya. Give ya even odds on that. He shakes; the others crowd around. David looks on, left out for the moment; Sarah and Les beside him.
KID BLINK => See ya in the funny papes, cowboy -- JACK Yeah, Blink, keep ya eye peeled. MUSH  Ya hear what he said -- Blink says... ya hear it? BOOTS We heard it. (offering marbles) My best shooters. Never know when ya need good shooters. SPOT Take it   easy, Jackie- boy. Ya    ever get in a spot -- (spits   in his palm;   shakes) -- think   of me.
CRUTCHY => Don't wanna alarm ya, Jack, but what I hear, out West ain't like New York at all -- it's fulla bulls, for one t'ing -- not cops, neither, but big ugly animals with horns and -- JACK  I'll miss ya, Crutch. Crutchy hobbles off to the dock. Jack looks off at the waiting coach, then holds out his hand to Les, who runs up and clings to him. 
JACK => Maybe that's what scares me... Suddenly, the emotions are too much for him -- he turns, runs across the square, not looking back, racing towards the coach. Les starts after him -- David catches him, holds him, as he and Sarah watch --
underscored. => As the coach moves off, the Newsies move up, waving their caps goodbye. David and Sarah watch, feeling a great loss; Les is crushed. The Newsies move into the court- yard, trying to keep their spirits up as: MUSIC BEGINS:       REPRISE:   "CARRYIN' THE BANNER"   APPROX: 3:00 The Newsies sing as they                        MUSH line up, trying to keep            TRY BOTTLE ALLEY OR THE their spirits up.                    HARBOR KID BLINK TRY CENTRAL PARK IT'S GUARANTEED BOOTS TRY ANY BANKER, BUM, OR BARBER CRUTCHY THEY ALMOST ALL KNOWS HOW TO READ.
LES => Comin' down the chute!
the gates. => Jack sings   out, the song soars,    continuing as the Newsies are back on   the job -- getting    their papers, fanning out across the   courtyard, into the    city beyond. It is indeed a fine life   as closing credits    roll until we --
