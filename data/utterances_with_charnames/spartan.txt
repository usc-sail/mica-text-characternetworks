SCOTT => Now: your mouth shut. Your eyes open, and form on me...Here's where we're going...
SCOTT => Don't look at him. Don't look at the Downed Man. He's dead... (as he turns his back on the scene) Kick the fool overboard...

BURCH => ...here in Boston...
MILLER => Yessir, and, that...that...
BURCH => Come on, let's hear it:
MILLER => That she may have been...that she may have been delivered - for sale - that she may have been sent down the pipeline and overseas.

MILLER => Sir: This is the number of a public phone in Downtown Boston.  It's a cutout, between the Bordello, and the abductors. A call is placed when they have a package to deliver.
BURCH => ...you going to stake out the phone...?
MILLER =>  We have a watch on the phone. More importantly: N.S.A. reports calls placed to that phone. Regularly.
BURCH => They can track calls to a payphone?
MILLER => In this case they can.
BURCH => How?
MILLER => They were made from a Federal Prison. (he gestures to the Aide, who shows to Burch and the camera a photo of a smiling man in his forties, in an expensive suit. Of photo:) This is Eli Assani. He is a Lebanese National, serving life without, for kidnapping. He was the head man in a white slavery scheme.
BURCH => And where is he?
MILLER => He's in Lewisberg. We have a Plan...  I hesitate to...
BURCH => Give it to me...
MILLER => They've got some action on the Payphone...

SCOTT => You don't want to go into the desert.
ANTON => ...they're moving...
SCOTT =>  ...what is this...?
ANTON =>  ...it's a wedding ring.

SCOTT => Nobody out there...  Just. Him.  You indicate that you heard me.  Put it out. (the Driver begins to speak softly, relaying his instructions on the radio. Scott turns to Anton. Softly) How you doing bright eyes...? (Anton nods. Beat, as Scott looks him over)
SCOTT => ...breathe through your nose.
SCOTT => It stills the heartrate.  You got my back.
ANTON => Sir, Yes, Sir.
SCOTT =>  ...alright, then...

ANTON => ...I...
SCOTT => ...tell it to the Chaplain.
SCOTT => Ah, shit...
BURCH =>  ...this is the man.  ...you're covered in blood.
SCOTT => Sir, it ain't mine. (Burch looks at Anton. Scott, seeing his glance) On my team, sir.
BURCH => How deep is he?
SCOTT =>  ...He's on the team.
BURCH => Yeah, well. He may have to be a little more than On the Team...  I've been speaking to the father. 
BURCH =>  What about if we had to go "off the meter"?
SCOTT => ...With the Mission, sir.
BURCH =>  ...I'm out of time...
BURCH => ...man to man.
SCOTT => The door's closed, Sir.
BURCH => I. Need. To Ask You. To do something. 
SCOTT => I am here to get the girl back.
BURCH => This man...Placed a phonecall. Yesterday. From the phonebank at Lewisberg. To the Copley Payphone.  Here's the cut-off-point... (he looks meaningfully at Scott.

ASSANI => Oh, ah, ah, but you do believe me...I see it...you do. I can get us out. Help me. I SWEAR TO YOU. HELP ME...and I will treat you like a brother...I...
SCOTT => My brother used to beat me (he raises the cop's service revolver and cocks the hammer) Nice guess, though.
ASSANI => OH GOD NO!
ASSANI => No, no. Listen to me...listen...make one call. One call - go in the house. Make One Call. ONE CALL. An Aviation Company.

SCOTT => Then why the hell you looking at me?
ASSANI => I was thinking...how fucking surprised you're going to be.  Because, Baby, you just did that fucken good turn, going to Make You Rich, Fat, and Happy...
SCOTT => ...just get me on that plane.
ASSANI => Didn't they tell you...?
SCOTT => All I heard's a voice on the phone...
ASSANI => ...you like girls...?
SCOTT => Better question, where you've been so long, do you like girls?
ASSANI => We have. You will have...the most beautiful...
SCOTT => ...most beautiful women, eh?
ASSANI => Not women, Baby. Girls. You got to trust me, I'm the Doctor here...All young. All blonde...
SCOTT => And this all takes place Where...?
ASSANI => In Dubai. In Yemen...
SCOTT => Well, that's a long way from Tiperrary, pal...
ASSANI => ...what do you have here...?
SCOTT => Yeah, but I'm not cut out, to live in a fucken tent. 
ASSANI => If you think you can imagine luxury...I am here to tell you, my friend... 
SCOTT => Well, may it Just Be So...
ASSANI => When we get to Maskala...
SCOTT => And, now, what's Maskala...?
ASSANI => ...when we get to Dubai, better...
SCOTT => What's Maskala...?
ASSANI => ...that's where we clean them up. We ship them Rough, we make them Smooth, and everybody's happy.
SCOTT => Well, then, you're a philosopher...huh...? How 'bout making me happy tonight...
ASSANI => If there's a girl, in the pipeline, tonight, you shall have her, what do you say to that?
SCOTT => ...I say you're a stone cold whoremaster...
ASSANI => No, no baby. Take it to the    bank. The Arabs, Man. All the oil    - all the money in the world.    What can't they have? Booze and    Pussy. How do they get it...?
SCOTT => You the candy man? Is that it?
SCOTT => Ah. Hell...
ASSANI => Yeah, no. I'm bleeding bad here, friend...
SCOTT =>  Yeah, we just, we got to get some...yeah, you need, all we need, some tailoring tools.
SCOTT => Yeah, in my wishlist, we had a drugstore, get us some morphine, some...
TV WOMAN => ...America's Number One Redhead, "She Sets the Style, She Brings a Smile", she's Betty co-ed, in College, and she's off for what her father's office says is an "extended sailing weekend".  With "person or persons unknown"...yo ho, yo Ho...she "old" enough for that, our "Little Red Riding-Hood", Cathy...?
ANTON =>  ...the helo just went down...
SCOTT => ...don't whisper to me, Baby, it draws heat. What helo?
ANTON => ...the assault helicopter. You've got no backup, at the house.  You'll be in there, alone, the first few minutes...
SCOTT => Well, there you go, then.
ANTON => You said "Never go in without an overwatch".
SCOTT => That's all fine, lad, "But this is the fleet".
ANTON => You know you deliver him in the door, you know they're going to waste you.
SCOTT => ...gimme whatever nine mil you've got...
SCOTT => ...just gimme the mags...  ...gimme your piece.
SCOTT => Thank you...
ANTON =>  Mister...mister: you forgot your change...
ANTON =>  ...you better take care of yourself, because...
ANTON => A...I'm alright...I'm alright...
MILLER => Your partner's going to be alright.
SCOTT => I do not look at the downed man, Sir...
MILLER => Yeah, well...
SCOTT => ...Sir...?
MILLER =>  Standing down's a bitch.
SCOTT => I stand down when the girl's back, sir.
MILLER => They'll get her out, if she's in there...  You did your part, what the fuck do you want, a Citation?
AIDE => ...sir...
MILLER => Where are you going.
SCOTT => On the dustoff.
MILLER => Forget it.
SCOTT => Sir...? Sir...?
MILLER => There's no room.
SCOTT => I'm pleading with you, sir...
MILLER => Let him hear the assault on the Net...
SCOTT => I want to see the girl.
JIM => The death, just reported, the death of Laura Newton. The... the...
JIM => Tracey, the Secret Service, for obvious reasons, their records, the DNA, fingerprints... the... and, she had just been in the water a scant, less than four hours, the...apparently the boat swamped... she -
TRACEY => She was sailing with...?
JIM => With her professor, Professor...? 
TRACEY => ...a Tragedy, such as this.
JIM => ...particularly. Particularly, Tracey, coming, right at the start of his Campaign...
TRACEY => Will he delay the start of the Campaign?
JIM => ...his grief...
TRACEY => ...he was very close to his daughter, wasn't he?
JIM => Well, indeed, he saw her, the day...that would be, the day before last. He was in Boston for the Strategy Meeting, and saw her then...
TRACEY =>  ...and that would be the Last time...that...
MILLER => Her boyfriend called her a slut. She went off to prove it. Her and the Professor. Coked up, boat capsized...Both bodies washed up naked. Coast Guard dressed 'em up...full of Ecstasy...
SCOTT => ...he killed her...
MILLER =>  He was fucking her, they're stoned...the boat capsized...
MILLER =>  ...so much death.
SCOTT =>  ...rock crushes scissors...
MILLER => I'm sorry about your man.
SCOTT => He isn't my man, Sir. He's a trainee.
ANTON => ...what time is it?
SCOTT => What do you care...? (pause. We see that Anton is having difficulty formulating his thoughts)
ANTON => I fucked up.
SCOTT => ...in what way was that?
ANTON => 
SCOTT => What? Do you want some more Dope? Whaddaya want, a Dr. Pepper...?
ANTON => ...but I was trying to help.
SCOTT => ...yeah, well, that's when people generally do fuck up. Wait for that to kick in. (Anton starts to lay back, and then, as if he is remembering something, he draws closer to Scott again.) You're gonna take that fight to bed for a while. You don't got to do it all now.
ANTON =>  I saw the sign.
SCOTT => ...uh huh...
ANTON =>  I saw the sign...at the Cape. In the House.
SCOTT => You saw-the-sign. What sign?
ANTON => ...when I dropped the guy. The girl's Picasso sign... (he draws the sign in the condensation on the plane's window) She was there. At the Cape. The girl was there.
SCOTT => The girl wasn't there. She was on a boat. She fell off the boat. She's dead.  You did what you could. You did what you were trained to do.  You did what you could.
ANTON => ...I saw the sign...
SCOTT =>  ...then you are Truly Blessed.
INTERROGATOR => ...from the house, a house, a holding facility, a compound? called Maskala. The girls are taken from Maskala, to the ...Royale Hotel, in Dubai. (he closes the notes, as if completing his presentation) As time passes, you may remember other aspects of...well,  You've heard this speech before...
SCOTT => ...would be most grateful, sir, to be included on the mission. "At Such Time..." 
BLANE => ...on a mission to Dubai.
SCOTT => Is it in contemplation, sir...? 
SCOTT => Yes, sir.  If and When, Sir...
BLANE => You need a rest, Bobby. (pause. as he extends his hand) Thank you, Bobby...
SCOTT => ...please don't touch that. (Scott picks up the duffle and puts the strap over his shoulder)
LECTURER => ...pick it up.
LECTURER => What are you studying here...? I'm talking to you, son... What are you studying?
TRAINEE => Sir, this Candidate is studying knife fighting.
LECTURER => Hold your ground, son.
LECTURER =>  ...you, and your friend...
LECTURER => There are two ways to fight, you can fight fair, or you can fight to win.
SCOTT => Don't you study knife fighting, son. You Learn to Kill. And then, f'you meet some other fellow, studied knife fighting, you send him to hell.
LECTURER => Next man:
LECTURER => Now: I want to see some evil intent.
GRACE => Hey, fuck it, Huh...?
SCOTT => I've always thought so.
GRACE => How'd the puppy like it out there? He piss in the punchbowl?
SCOTT => He did okay.
GRACE => I heard he caught poison ivy.
SCOTT => He did okay. Why? You goin' out?
GRACE => What?
SCOTT => You recruiting?
GRACE => Why would I be recruiting?
SCOTT => You speak Arabic, huh...?
GRACE => That's what the Arabs tell me.
SCOTT => You, reason I ask: you going in the Sandbox...?
GRACE => Ain't you overdue for some Down Time?
SCOTT => I'm just saying:
GRACE => Yeah. You Marines are a weepy bunch of motherfuckers. (Scott nods minutely in acknowledgement. And returns to watching the television) ...you get a chance to bowl in that tournament...?
SCOTT =>  ...beautiful girl...
TRUCKER => ...you say something, Mister...?
SCOTT => No, I was looking at the television.  I was talking to the television. (he turns to look at the girl) That girl's too good-looking for you anyway. What are you "rich"? What do you, "own" something? 
SCOTT =>  Or are you "funny" or something...? (pause. Hold for a beat, on the confused face of the Trucker) Siddown. Lemme buy you a drink.
SCOTT => You peel the apple?
SCOTT =>  ...well. You should wipe off the blade. 
SCOTT =>  I'm   sorry if I frightened you. 
GIRL => ...it's an odd knife.
SCOTT => Yeah. I got it from a Russian fellow.
GIRL => Was it a gift...?
SCOTT => No. As I remember, he seemed rather reluctant to part with it.  It's just a knife.
PROPRIETOR => How you been, John...?
SCOTT => ...workin hard...
PROPRIETOR => ...bet you have...
SCOTT => How you, Billy...?
PROPRIETOR => ...one gallon goin to do it...?
SCOTT =>  ...you been lookin' at my house...?
PROPRIETOR => Nope, just trine a sell you some paint... (as he puts the cup down in front of Scott. Joking) ...but, now you mention it...
NEW FARMER => ...John...
SCOTT => Mr. Reese, how are you...? (Billy goes to take care of the new customer, and turns back to deal with Scott, who is waiting to ask a question) That new saw blade come in?
BILLY =>  No, John. It did not. I beg your pardon. I know that's your baby...I'm gone call them up and get Right On That.
BILLY =>  ...'spected you back a few days ago...
SCOTT =>  I took the Long Way Home.
SCOTT => Could I see your Right Hand, please...?
ANTON => There's nothing in my right hand.
SCOTT => Could I see it, please...?
SCOTT => You put your wedding ring back on.
ANTON =>  ...yes...?
SCOTT => Then I have to guess you're not "on assignment".  You're in the wrong place, baby.  How did you find me...?
SCOTT => Well, I guess I'm not as smart as I thought I was. 
ANTON => I need to talk to you.
ANTON => I saw the sign.
SCOTT => "You saw the sign". You were up for a week, you coulda seen Jack Ruby, you don't know what you saw...your first-time-out.
ANTON => I saw the sign.
SCOTT => ...then, you tell me: you saw the sign, how is it, they found the girl, the DNA...why would they do that...? Her father? Her father would do that to her?
ANTON => ...maybe he doesn't know...
SCOTT => Well. You're living in a fairyland of your Own Devising. You're seeing snakes. 
ANTON => Who's going to Dubai...?  They've got a white slave ring, in Dubai, with American girls there - are they going in?  Are they sending you in...?  Ask them... 
SCOTT => You Got. To Leave it for your Betters.
ANTON => Ask them.
SCOTT => Why would you want to know?  Listen up, Pal. THEY don't go through the door. WE don't ask why. That's not a COST, it's a Benefit. Because we Got to Travel Light. You wanna lose sleep over it, get over it, or get out.  You wanted to go Through the Looking Glass. How was it? Was it more fun than Miniature Golf...?
ANTON => I want a favor.
SCOTT => Why would I do you a favor?
OLD LADY => Morning, John, who's your friend...?
SCOTT => Fella wants to buy my car.
ANTON => I saved your life.
SCOTT => Well what were they paying you for...?
ANTON => Bobby, I saw the Sign...
SCOTT => My name ain't Bobby. 
ANTON => I saw the sign. (he draws the Picasso sign in the dust on the window of the country store) I Saw it. At the beach house.  I'm going back.
SCOTT => Back?
ANTON => To the beach house.
SCOTT => They took it apart with a tweezers. 
ANTON => She was there. The Girl was There. I'm going back.  I want you to do something.
SCOTT => What would that be?
ANTON => The Secret Service Agent. Offed himself.
SCOTT => ...he was off boffing his girl.
ANTON => He shot himself with a hide-out pistol.
SCOTT => Yeah?
ANTON => Who frisked the sonofabitch?  You ask them.
STODDARD => Number one, the girl's dead. Number two, the hide-out gun the Agent shot with's registered in his 1020 for the past five years. The man who tossed him has been sacked. His name is none of your concern. Now: what the fuck are you doing here?
SCOTT => Sir, I am not here to question...
STODDARD => Well, then, what the fuck are you doing here...?
MILLER => Sir, as he said, he is here to apprise you of a security leak...
SCOTT => ...and...
MILLER => To call your attention to what may be a problem in discipline with this...
STODDARD => Granted. Granted.  Granted. Fine. Thank you.
SCOTT => And. Sir...If I may...
STODDARD => What is it?
SCOTT => When the operation is staged in Dubai...
STODDARD => What is this...?
MILLER => He...
STODDARD => ...what the fuck are you talking about?
SCOTT => I am merely saying, when -
STODDARD => Forget it. Walk away.
SCOTT => I...
STODDARD => Yeah...you're a pit bull. I said forget it. How do we contact Anton?
MILLER => ...Anton...
STODDARD => Your partner...He's gone to ground...
MILLER => Yes, sir...
STODDARD => And, wait, wait, wait, wait, what does this mean...?  When and if, any operation is staged which may require your talents, I give you my word... (Scott shakes his head, saying "I don't believe a word of it") You impertinent motherfucker. What the fuck is with you, you've got on your "thinkingcap" all of a sudden...?
SCOTT => I'd like to finish what I started.
STODDARD => And I'm telling you to Stand Down. Where's the kid? 
SCOTT => Is there no operation in Dubai...?
PASTOR => ...in the Service. In the Service of his Country. No less than had he died in Combat. George Gaines, a man who gave his life to service, to protecting those who...
DRIVER => ...sucker did the Dutch.
SCOTT => I heard it was a training accident.
DRIVER => Nope, he Ate the Gun. Didn't you know?
SCOTT => I've been out of town.
DRIVER => Punched out early, off with the girlfriend, his Principal wanders off, winds up dead: hari-kari...
DRIVER => ...rather you didn't smoke in here.
BURCH => I put myself in your hands. Didn't I...?
SCOTT => I do not follow you, sir.
BURCH => I reached out to you.  I put my life into your hands. I entered into a conspiracy with you. To commit Murder. Because it needed to be done.  I trusted you with my life.
SCOTT => I would never betray you, sir.
BURCH =>  I trusted you with my life. And yet you cannot trust me.  There are things you have not been told. That's right.  And now you're all out-of-line, "Play me or trade me..." 
BURCH =>  There is an Arab World. To penetrate it makes trying to join the Mafia look like a walk in the park. How would you do it, Scott?  We're dying. We're at war. And we have no intelligence. How Would you do it? How would you infiltrate their clan structure? Where is the interface?  It's at the whorehouse. That's where they go to get frisky, and that's where we listen to them. 
BURCH => For the few, priceless hints that we get from that fucking sandpile.  Had the girl been there, we would have moved heaven and earth - you know we would, and, we would have got her out. She was not there. She got drugged up and fell off a boat, and drowned. She's dead.  That man, (Burch gestures at the photograph-on-the- easel, of George Gaines, the Secret Service man, which stands by the head of the grave) That man a sworn office of the Secret Service, went to get laid, and she died. And you are risking the lives of men and women in the field, because you won't take orders. How are you better than him? Yes. You had best look sheepish. What the fuck have you got to say?
SCOTT => No excuse, sir.
BURCH => You're goddam right.  Now: where's this new kid who got you all bothered. Where's your partner?
SCOTT => ...I'll call him off.
BURCH => The fuck you will. You've got nothing to say to him. He's gone to the ground. Where is he...?
SCOTT =>  Terrible thing.  Did you know him?
MAN => Did you know him...?  Where did you know him from?
SCOTT =>  ...you know.
MAN =>  He wasn't in the accounting office. You knew that...
SCOTT => Yes. I Did.
MAN => I didn't think, he told anyone what he did. Because...because...  I...
SCOTT => A few of us knew. 
MAN => And all he cared    about was doing his duty...that's    all...that's all... He used to    tell me... 
SCOTT => I'm so sorry.
MAN => He was supposed to see me that night...After his "shift"...We...His wife...
SCOTT => Did she know? His wife. Did she know?
MAN => How could she? How could she...she didn't know him...  Oh, the poor children...
MAN => ...he was going to come to me that night...after...
SCOTT => ...after his shift.
MAN => ...his shift - yes...
BURLY MAN => ...excuse me...
MAN => ...after, after he'd finished driving him...
SCOTT => ...him...?
BURLY MAN =>  I said...
SCOTT => 
BURLY MAN => Yeah. It's a man's world, pal - but you're in the wrong bar.
SECOND MAN => ...what the fuck did you do to my friend...?
SCOTT => ...where are you...? No. Tell me later. Look: LOOK: Forget the boat house. Look:  Yes, tell me in...tel...look: tell me when...GET OUT OF THERE. 
SCOTT => GET OUT OF THERE RIGHT NOW. TELL ME WHEN YOU SEE ME. MEET ME "WHERE...WHERE THE GUY MADE THE PHONECALL" - ONE HALF-HOUR...
SCOTT => ...ohmigod...
SCOTT => What the hell are you doing?
BELLBOY =>  I...I brought you...
SCOTT => Why're you screwing with the door...?
BELLBOY => I...I...
SCOTT => Why're you screwing with the door...?
BELLBOY => I took the...I took the sign off...  You had the sign on the door. F'they saw me...f'they saw me, knocking on a door, the sign on...they'd... (Scott relaxes somewhat. The Bellboy proffers the package) An, I...I figured, you needed... (he hands the package to Scott, who takes out a pint bottle of booze) You told me you wanted this at Ten...
SCOTT => ...yeah. Thanks.
BELLBOY =>  ...I don't know why you...
SCOTT => You're right, I'm wrong...I'm wrong.
SCOTT => There you go, Pal. Hold on...
BELLBOY =>  Sure. I just...I just wanted to help.
SCOTT => It's been...quite a while since my last confession. That...that "transpired". On the rear face of a hill, in a mortar attack.  And I confessed that I was frightened.  And I have to confess, I'm frightened now.  'Nother "irregular Confession".
SCOTT => ...I'm about as frightened as I'm comfortable being.  And that's why...I involved you.  Which, I suppose, was shameful.
JACKIE BLACK => Now: you did me the honor to Call me. Now: you tell me how I might help.  There in't nobody here, but two people in Green. 
SCOTT =>  ...this girl's alive...
JACKIE BLACK => Then, you'd better go get her.
WOMAN => ...terrible thing, grief...
WOMAN => ...you want to comfort them, but you don't know how.  I always think it's better to Leave Them Alone...
SCOTT =>  A relative?
WOMAN => A psychic. 
SCOTT => Well.  Can we blame her...? (he gestures, meaning, we get comfort where we can find it)
WOMAN => That's right.
WOMAN => ...who are you...?
SCOTT =>  United States Secret Service.
WOMAN => Guess again, 'cause I'm the Secret Service, and you follow my directions or I will shoot you dead. Spread your hands to your sides, please... (Scott spreads his hands to his sides) Open them...
DONNY =>  ...the motherfuckers pulled the Detail off of her...He was in town. Her father was in town, they pulled the Secret Service Detail off her, to take him tomcatting. He's been doing it for years. That's what they do. They turn the Secret Service into a bunch of pimps. He took her protection, she got snatched...
SCOTT => He'd let her die?
FEMALE AGENT => ...leaving the post...
DONNY =>  The start of a campaign: Your daughter got kidnapped because you were out getting laid?
SCOTT => Her father would let her die...?
DONNY => Who knows if he knows. His 'people' would let her die in a heartbeat.
SCOTT => ...her mother...?
DONNY =>  I'm her mother...
SCOTT => I need some money.  I'm going to get the girl back.
DONNY => What can I do?
SCOTT => I need money. I need a lot of money.
DONNY =>  I've been signing her checks for years.
SCOTT => Alright... (he scribbles a figure on a napkin) Can you go this high, that's what I need...
DONNY =>  ...I...I   don't...is there anywhere   else you...
AVI => Didn't they tell you not to come?
SCOTT => Well, I guess I wasn't paying attention. 
AVI => Five years ago they told me you were dead.
SCOTT => You want to gossip, or you want to do business...?
AVI => Bobby; this is an American girl...?
SCOTT => If that were so?
AVI => If that were so, why don't your people go and fetch her...?
AVI => ...they send a hitter to negotiate...?  My question is: have you forgot your catechism...?
SCOTT => And what's the answer?
AVI => The answer is Go Home.
SCOTT => Yeah, that's a good one.
AVI => ...you're at the Big Table here.
SCOTT => I know where I am.
AVI => Well, then, you better talk to me using the Decimal System.
SCOTT => Your intel. Two men. Infil, exfil, hardware, and com.
AVI => And com to what? I cannot give you.
SCOTT => Well, you could, when you where in the Boy Scouts.
AVI => Yes, but I am not in the Boy Scouts anymore. You heard the private sector?
SCOTT => Yeah.
AVI => Well. That's where you found me. And here's what it costs.
SCOTT =>  ...you're out of your mind.
AVI => No, you're out of your fucking mind, and you're out of your league, and my advice to you:...before some mercantile soul shops you. (pause. In disgust, he picks up the paper, crosses out what we wrote, and puts in a new number) ...for this job, that's what it costs...
SCOTT => ...that's what it costs...?
AVI => That's what it costs you.  Go home, Bobby.
SCOTT => Remember me...?
SCOTT => ...well, I guess you do have friends in High Places...I mean here you are home, n'all... (he picks up now one, now another piece of exquisite statuary, and smashes it to the ground) And now we're gonna see if you also got all that money that you spoke of. (he takes out a videotape box) This here's a Short Subject, if you know what I mean. Of you in Carnal Congress with an Underage Girl. A PROSTITUE, A MINOR, AND SOMEBODY'S DAUGHTER...  There's another...you know how cheap it is to make a copy...?
BUSINESSMAN => ...what do you want?
SCOTT => I want what you promised me...
BUSINESSMAN =>  ...I've, I've already made a deal with...
SCOTT => Yeah, but you haven't made a deal with me...So, today is Your Lucky Day, cause you get to Do, what Most Men only Dream of: You get to make Another Human Being Happy.
SCOTT =>  You had your fun, now pay for it, Jim. Get your bank on the phone. We're going to transfer some money.
SCOTT =>  ..."how about that".
BUSINESSMAN => ...do you know how much trouble you're in...?
SCOTT => Yes. And that's the difference between you and me.
AVI => Maskala is a suburban villa, in Dubai. The Friends of your Friend, (he gestures at a photo of Assani) Operate there, if you will, a "halfway house". For the young women they have induced, coerced or drugged into spending their short lives. As the whores of Arabian tourists. Of late the girls have been, in the main, from the former Sov-Bloc. Now and again, a North American Girl, if she is exceedingly lovely,...blonde, usually blonde... (he passes the photos of very beautiful young girls across the table, to Scott) Will, unfortunately, find her way to Dubai. They travel drugged, they are -  - "tidied up", and sold. For some reason, most of them are sold to Yemen.  The girls are generally held, in Dubai, until the end of the month. (he checks his watch and looks significantly at it) When the Merrymakers fly in to examine them. And take their purchases home.
SCOTT => ...and then?
AVI =>  That is "and then".  This is a floor plan of the building where the girls are held, this is the security arrangements, this is the watch plan. 
AVI =>  The girls are taken from the house in Maskala, to the Royale Hotel, I presume you will hit them in transit...?
SCOTT =>  ..."Jameson Construction"...They know we're there...?
AVI => I hope not.  The conex container for the exfil, also Jameson Construction. (he gestures at the materials on the table) A passport for the Young Girl...  Between fifteen and twenty-five, they all look alike.
SCOTT =>  Is that your experience...?
AVI => Yes. It is. Nonetheless, we tried to match it to a Current Photo...
AVI => ...she was there twelve hours ago.
SCOTT => Who took the photo?
AVI =>  How would I know...? 
SCOTT => What does the bonus cost?
AVI =>  A gesture of Friendship. But. We thought: if you see some of the Yemenins - (he shows Scott candid photos of several middle-aged, bearded middle-eastern looking men) Any of these, in particular...would you say Hello to them?
SCOTT => Who else have you done a favor for, Avi?
AVI => Bobby: the world runs on manners.
SCOTT => The last third on exfil, in Geneva. Me and the Girl. As agreed.
AVI => That's not what I was going to say.
SCOTT => What were you going to say...?  ...the Last Third in Geneva... 
SCOTT => ...fourteen, fifteen, sixteen.
SCOTT => It's good.  It's very good.  The charge takes the car out...  We got the flashbangs fore and aft, You hit the driver, follow down the driver's side, the car ain't going nowhere, the muscle gets out, I cap em, I go with the girl. (he points to Jones. He points to the car. Jones nods. To Smith) You exfil on your own, we're on to the airport.
SCOTT => At the airport. When we hit the Conex. When you Seal Us In...you walk away.
JONES => I understand.
SCOTT => I cannot have heat on it. Now: I know: that you want to protect the package. But: you have to walk away. And que sera, sera.
JONES => I won't look back.
SCOTT =>  ...it's an appleseed.
SMITH =>  "Johnny Appleseed", eh?
SCOTT => ...yeah, I'm just a Man of Peace...
BODYGUARD => ...stay in your room, and...
LAURA => ...who...?
SCOTT => Stay by me.
LAURA => ...they said they were going to take care of me...
SCOTT => I'm going to take care of you. You hold on, now. (as Scott drives he reloads his weapons)
LAURA =>  Who are you?
SCOTT => ...you remember, Baby, we went to high school together...  You dropped your earring.
SCOTT => You're Picasso, right...? That's who you are...
LAURA => ...they're going to send me to a Party.
SCOTT => No, Baby, you're going Home.  You're just taking the long way home.
SCOTT => ...I told you to stay on the bed.
SCOTT => ...you're going travelling.
LAURA => ...what...?
SCOTT => ...we're going to take a little trip.
SCOTT => ...put that away.
LAURA => ...I need a smoke.
SCOTT => Y'can't smoke it. American tobacco. Smell. Carry. In the desert air.
SCOTT => Put that on. Over your head.
LAURA => Whatsamatter, you don't like Blondes...?
SCOTT => Whole world likes Blondes. That's why you're here. Put the bandana on.
LAURA =>  ...gimme the fucken smoke.
LAURA => I could make you give me the smoke.
SCOTT => Keep it together. (he takes a small hypodermic kit) Keep it together, or I'm gonna give you a shot and carry you out.
LAURA => Nobody Cares about me...
SCOTT => ...that's right...
LAURA => ...I'm just a whore...They wouldn't even come get me...
SCOTT => They sent me...
LAURA => Did my father send you?
SCOTT =>  ...that's right.
LAURA =>  One man.
SCOTT => One riot, one Ranger, you ever hear that?
LAURA => Leonides, the King of Sparta, when a neighboring state would beg for Military Aid. Would send One Man.
SCOTT => ...well, there you go.
LAURA => ...you ever hear that?
SCOTT => No. I think we went to different schools.
SCOTT => ...put the bandana on.
LAURA =>  Did you hear the one about the king who turned his daughter into Gold?
SCOTT => Yeah - I heard that one.
LAURA => ...I don't want to go home.
SCOTT => I didn't ask you.
LAURA => I don't know where we are...
SCOTT => You just keep it together.
SCOTT =>  You put this on.
LAURA =>  ...what...?
SCOTT => You...
SCOTT => A little walk-in-the-park. (he points her to the News jet) See there...?
SECOND MAN =>  ...all of the passenger terminals, and all access-points to the Cargo and General Aviation...
LAURA =>  No, you know what my mistake was...?
SCOTT =>  ...what was that...?
SCOTT => ...what was your mistake...?
LAURA =>  ...you think we bring our troubles on ourselves...?
SCOTT => I'm certain of it.
SCOTT => No, no...come on baby...come on, come on girl: just walk to the plane: Just Get On the Plane...WALK TO THE PLANE...
SCOTT => Shussh, baby... shussh... shussh... it's going to be alright...
SCOTT => This's going to make Everything Allright...
LAURA => No!
STODDARD => Leave her Alone.  Don't shoot him, don't shoot, you'll blow the thing sky high...
SCOTT => Laura...
STODDARD => Thank God we Found you. You know me. I work for Mister Burch. I've met you...
LAURA =>  He said that he came to get me... (she shakes her head in disbelief. Then she starts to walk a step toward Scott, then turns, and proceeds toward Stoddard.)
STODDARD => That's right, Laura...Walk away from him. Walk to the Plane...He can't hurt you now. Walk to the plane...
SCOTT =>  No...
STODDARD => DON'T SHOOT, DON'T SHOOT, DON'T SHOOT HIM IN HERE...
STODDARD => Cuff 'im...
STODDARD =>  Yes...well...
SCOTT => Let the girl go home. 
STODDARD =>  ...wait till she lifts off, take him outside and shoot him.
SCOTT =>  ...why can't the Girl Go Home?
STODDARD => Because she's dead.  You had to know the Secret Knowledge. Didn't you?
SCOTT => What is the Secret Knowledge?
STODDARD => The Secret Knowledge is: There Is No Secret Knowledge. (turns over his shoulder, to look at Laura, walking toward the plane) You went Beyond What Was Permitted. And the Gods Are Angry.
LAURA => ...I'm so tired.
WOMAN => ...I'm going to ask you to do Just the One More Thing...
WOMAN => I'm going to ask you, now, to walk away from this plane, and come with me.
bizjet => is still on station outside of the bizjet, and that the woman who is walking and talking with Laura is Jackie Black, the young female sergeant we met earlier. Laura looks at her uncomprehendingly. Laura begins shaking her head pathetically, and protesting, drawing away from Jackie Black.
LAURA => No...leave me alone. No - I don't know you...
STODDARD => 
FEMALE REPORTER => Oh, my God...
STODDARD =>  Wait...!
JACKIE BLACK =>  Keep walking...
HENCHMAN =>  ...do you want me to...?
FEMALE REPORTER => Gimme an uplink Gimme an uplink... GET IT ON THE SAT. Now Now Now...
FEMALE REPORTER =>  On her. On her, get it on the girl...Get us Out of Here...
SCOTT => The girl ain't dead, baby, you're dead. You see: that's the difference.
STODDARD => WAIT: WAIT. The girl's home. You brought her home. Now, listen to me, because I am going to tell you...now, you wanted to be "inside"...I am going to take you as far inside as you can go: Z'at what you want...? Is that what you want?
SCOTT => No, I just wanted to bring the girl back.
JACKIE BLACK => ...is she safe?
SCOTT => That's right, she's safe.
JACKIE BLACK =>  ...well, then...
SCOTT => ...that's right, Baby...
