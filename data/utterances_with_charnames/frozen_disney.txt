KING => Do what you must.
GRAND PABBIE => I recommend we remove all magic, even memories of magic to be safe.... But don't worry, I'll leave the fun.
GRAND PABBIE => She will be okay.

YOUNG ANNA => IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE A SNOWMAN.
YOUNG ELSA => Go away, Anna.
YOUNG ANNA =>  ...OKAY BYE.
KING => The gloves will help.
KING => See? You're good....  Conceal it.
YOUNG ELSA => Don't feel it.

HANS => Princess...? My Lady.
ANNA => Hi...again.
HANS => Oh boy.
ANNA => Ha. This is awkward. Not you're awkward, but just because we're-- I'm awkward. You're gorgeous.  Wait, what?
HANS => I'd like to formally apologize for hitting the Princess of Arendelle with my horse...and for every moment after.
ANNA => No. No-no. It's fine. I'm not THAT Princess. I mean, if you'd hit my sister Elsa, that would be-- yeash! `Cuz, you know...  Hello.  FROZEN - J. Lee

ELSA => And what is that amazing smell?
KAI => Your Majesty. The Duke of Weaseltown.
DUKE => Weselton. The Duke of Weselton.  Your Majesty, as your closest partner in trade, it seems only fitting that I offer you your first dance as queen.
DUKE =>  One, two, three. Jump.
ELSA =>  Thank you...only I don't dance. FROZEN - J. Lee
DUKE =>  Oh...?
ELSA => But my sister does.
ANNA => What?
DUKE => Lucky you....
ANNA => Oh, I don't think--
DUKE => If you swoon, let me know, I'll catch you.
ELSA => Sorry.
DUKE => Like an agile peacock... CLUCK- CLUGGLE-CLUCK!
ANNA => Ow. Ow.
DUKE => Speaking of, so great to have the gates open. Why did they shut them in the first place? Do you know the reason? Hmm?
ANNA => ...No. FROZEN - J. Lee
DUKE => Oh, all right. Hang on. They don't call me the little dipper for nothing.
DUKE =>  Like a chicken...with the face of a monkey...I fly.
DUKE => Let me know when you're ready for another round, M'Lady.
ELSA => Well, he was sprightly.
ANNA =>  Especially for a man in heels.
ELSA => Are you okay?
ANNA =>  I've never been better. This is so nice. I wish it could be like this all the time.
ELSA =>  Me too....
ELSA => But it can't.
ANNA => Why not? If--
ELSA => It just can't. FROZEN - J. Lee
ANNA => Excuse me for a minute.
HANS => Glad I caught you.
ANNA => Hans.
ANNA => I often had the whole parlor to myself to slide... Oops. Sorry.
ANNA => ...Your physique helps I'm sure.
HANS =>  What's this?
ANNA => I was born with it, although I dreamt I was kissed by a troll.
HANS => I like it.
DISSOLVE TO => FROZEN - J. Lee
ANNA => Yeah, the whole thing! You got it.
ANNA => Okay wait, wait. So you have how many brothers?
HANS => Twelve older brothers. Three of them pretended I was invisible... literally...for two years.
ANNA => That's horrible.
HANS => It's what brothers do.
ANNA => ...And sisters. Elsa and I were really close when we were little. But then, one day she just shut me out, and I never knew why.
HANS => I would never shut you out.
ANNA => Okay, can I just say something crazy?
HANS => I love crazy.
ANNA =>  ALL MY LIFE HAS BEEN A SERIES OF DOORS IN MY FACE. AND THEN SUDDENLY I BUMP INTO YOU.
HANS => I was thinking the same thing, because like. . .  FROZEN - J. Lee
HANS => I'VE BEEN SEARCHING MY WHOLE LIFE TO FIND MY OWN PLACE. AND MAYBE IT'S THE PARTY TALKING, OR THE CHOCOLATE FONDUE.
ANNA => BUT WITH YOU-
HANS => BUT WITH YOU, I FOUND MY PLACE.
ANNA => I SEE YOUR FACE.
BOTH => AND IT'S NOTHING LIKE I'VE EVER KNOWN BEFORE.

ANNA => We would like--
HANS => --your blessing--
ANNA => --of--
ANNA/HANS => --our marriage!
ELSA => Marriage...?
ANNA => Yes!
ELSA => I'm sorry, I'm confused.
ANNA => Well, we haven't worked out all the details ourselves. We'll need a few days to plan the ceremony. Of course we'll have soup, roast, and ice cream and then-- Wait. Would we live here?
ELSA => Here? FROZEN - J. Lee
HANS => Absolutely!
ELSA => Anna--
ANNA => Oh, we can invite all twelve of your brothers to stay with us--
ELSA => What? No, no, no, no, no.
ANNA => Of course we have the room. I don't know. Some of them must--
ELSA => Wait. Slow down. No one's brothers are staying here. No one is getting married.
ANNA => Wait, what?
ELSA => May I talk to you, please. Alone.
ANNA => No. Whatever you have to say, you- you can say to both of us.
ELSA => Fine. You can't marry a man you just met.
ANNA => You can if it's true love.
ELSA => Anna, what do you know about true love?
ANNA => More than you. All you know is how to shut people out.
ELSA => You asked for my blessing, but my answer is no. Now, excuse me. FROZEN - J. Lee
HANS => Your Majesty, if I may ease your--
ELSA =>  No, you may not. And I-I think you should go.
ELSA => The party is over. Close the gates.
ANNA => What? Elsa, no. No, wait!
ELSA => Give me my glove!
ANNA =>  Elsa, please. Please. I can't live like this anymore.
ELSA =>  ...Then leave.
ANNA =>  ...What did I ever do to you?!
ELSA => Enough, Anna.
ANNA => No. Why? Why do you shut me out?! Why do you shut the world out?! What are you so afraid of?!
ELSA => I said, enough! FROZEN - J. Lee
DUKE =>  ...Sorcery. I knew there was something dubious going on here.
ANNA => Elsa...?
CROWD => There she is. Your Majesty! Long live the Queen! Queen Elsa.... Come drink with us.
BOWING TOWNSMAN => Queen Elsa.
DUKE => There she is! Stop her!
ELSA =>  Please, just stay away from me. Stay away!
DUKE => Monster.... Monster! FROZEN - J. Lee
ANNA => Elsa!
ANNA => Elsa! Wait, please!

HANS =>  Look.... The fjord.
CROWD WALLAH => Snow? It's...snow...in July. FROZEN - J. Lee
HANS => ...Are you all right?
ANNA =>  No.
HANS => Did you know?
ANNA => No.
DUKE => Look! It's snowing! It's snowing! The Queen has cursed this land! She must be stopped!  You have to go after her.
ANNA => Wait, no!
DUKE => You! Is there sorcery in you, too? Are you a monster, too?
ANNA => No. No. I'm completely ordinary.
HANS => That's right she is... (realizing how that sounds) ...in the best way.
ANNA => ...And my sister's not a monster.
DUKE => She nearly killed me.
HANS => You slipped on ice.
DUKE => Her ice! FROZEN - J. Lee
ANNA => It was an accident. She was scared. She didn't mean it. She didn't mean any of this.... Tonight was my fault. I pushed her. So I'm the one that needs to go after her.
DUKE => Yes. Fine. Do.
HANS => What?
ANNA =>  Bring me my horse, please.
HANS => Anna, no. It's too dangerous.
ANNA => Elsa's not dangerous. I'll bring her back, and I'll make this right.
HANS => I'm coming with you.
ANNA => No, I need you here to take care of Arendelle.
HANS => ...On my honor.
ANNA =>  I leave Prince Hans in charge!

ELSA => LET IT GO. LET IT GO. TURN AWAY AND SLAM THE DOOR. I DON'T CARE WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO SAY. LET THE STORM RAGE ON. THE COLD NEVER BOTHERED ME ANYWAY.
ELSA => IT'S FUNNY HOW SOME DISTANCE MAKES EVERYTHING SEEM SMALL. AND THE FEARS THAT ONCE CONTROLLED ME CAN'T GET TO ME AT ALL. IT'S TIME TO SEE WHAT I CAN DO, TO TEST THE LIMITS AND BREAK THROUGH. NO RIGHT, NO WRONG, NO RULES FOR ME...I'M FREE!
ELSA => LET IT GO! LET IT GO! I AM ONE WITH THE WIND AND SKY. LET IT GO! LET IT GO! YOU'LL NEVER SEE ME CRY. HERE I STAND AND HERE I'LL STAY.
ELSA => LET THE STORM RAGE ON....
ELSA => MY POWER FLURRIES THROUGH THE AIR INTO THE GROUND. MY SOUL IS SPIRALING IN FROZEN FRACTALS ALL AROUND. AND ONE THOUGHT CRYSTALLIZES LIKE AN ICY BLAST-
ELSA => I'M NEVER GOING BACK,  THE PAST IS IN THE PAST!
ELSA => LET IT GO! LET IT GO! AND I'LL RISE LIKE THE BREAK OF DAWN. LET IT GO! LET IT GO!
ELSA => THAT PERFECT GIRL IS GONE. HERE I STAND IN THE LIGHT OF DAY. LET THE STORM RAGE ON!! THE COLD NEVER BOTHERED ME ANYWAY.
ANNA =>  Elsa! Elsa! It's me, Anna...your sister who didn't mean to make you freeze the summer. I'm sorry. It's all my f-f-f-f-f-f-fault.
ANNA =>  Of course, none of this would have happened if she'd just told me her secret...ha...she's a stinker.
ANNA => Oh no. No. No. No. Come back. No. No. No. No.... Oooo-kay.
ANNA => Snow, it had to be snow, she couldn't have had tr-tr-tropical magic that covered the f-f-fjords in white sand and warm --
ANNA => Fire! WHOA!
ANNA =>  Cold, cold, cold, cold, cold...
ANNA => Wandering Oaken's Trading Post.
ANNA => Ooh! And Sauna...
OAKEN => Hoo hoo.
OAKEN => Big summer blow out. Half off swimming suits, clogs, and a sun balm of my own invention, yah?
ANNA => Oh, great. For now, how about boots. Winter boots...and dresses? FROZEN - J. Lee
OAKEN =>  That would be in our winter department.
ANNA => Oh. Um, I was just wondering; has another young woman, the Queen perhaps, I don't know, passed through here?
OAKEN => Only one crazy enough to be out in this storm is you, dear?
OAKEN => You and this fellow.... Hoo hoo. Big summer blow out.
KRISTOFF =>  Carrots.
ANNA => Huh?
KRISTOFF => Behind you.
ANNA => Oh, right. Excuse me.
OAKEN =>  A real howler in July, yah? Where ever could it be coming from?
KRISTOFF => The North Mountain. FROZEN - J. Lee
ANNA =>  North Mountain.
OAKEN => That'll be forty.
KRISTOFF => Forty? No, ten.
OAKEN =>  Oh dear, that's no good. See these are from our winter stock, where supply and demand have a big problem.
KRISTOFF => You want to talk about a supply and demand problem? I sell ice for a living.
ANNA => Ooh, that's a rough business to be in right now. I mean, that is really...  Ahem. That's unfortunate.
OAKEN => Still forty. But I will throw in a visit to Oaken's sauna. Hoo hoo! Hi, family.
NAKED FAMILY => Hoo hoo!
KRISTOFF => ...Ten's all I got. Help me out.
OAKEN =>  Ten will get you this and no more.
ANNA => Okay, just tell me one thing; what was happening on the North Mountain? Did it seem magical?
KRISTOFF => Yes! Now, back up while I deal with this crook here.
OAKEN => What did you call me?
KRISTOFF => Okay. Okay, I'm- Ow! Whoa!
OAKEN => Bye bye.
KRISTOFF => No Sven, I didn't get your carrots.
KRISTOFF => But I did find us a place to sleep. And it's free.
OAKEN =>  I'm sorry about this violence. I will add a quart of lutefisk, so we'll have good feelings. Just the outfit and boots, yah? FROZEN - J. Lee
KRISTOFF => REINDEERS ARE BETTER THAN PEOPLE. SVEN, DON'T YOU THINK THAT'S TRUE?
KRISTOFF =>  YEAH, PEOPLE WILL BEAT YOU & CURSE YOU & CHEAT YOU. EVERY ONE OF EM'S BAD, EXCEPT YOU.  Oh, thanks, Buddy.  BUT PEOPLE SMELL BETTER THAN REINDEERS. SVEN, DON'T YOU THINK I'M RIGHT?
ANNA => Nice duet.
KRISTOFF => Oh, it's just you. What do you want?
ANNA => I want you to take me up the North Mountain. FROZEN - J. Lee
KRISTOFF => I don't take people places.
ANNA => Let me rephrase that...
KRISTOFF => Umph.
ANNA => Take me up the North Mountain.... Please.
ANNA => Look, I know how to stop this winter.
KRISTOFF => We leave at dawn.... And you forgot the carrots for Sven.
KRISTOFF => Ugh!
ANNA => Oops. Sorry. Sorry. I'm sorry. I didn't--  We leave now. Right now.
beside him. => FROZEN - J. Lee
KRISTOFF =>  Hang on! We like to go fast!
ANNA =>  I like fast!
KRISTOFF => Whoa, whoa! Get your feet down.
KRISTOFF => This is fresh lacquer. Seriously, were you raised in a barn?
ANNA =>  Ew. No, I was raised in a castle.
KRISTOFF => So tell me, what made the Queen go all ice-crazy?
ANNA => ...Oh well, it was all my fault. I got engaged but then she freaked out because I'd only just met him, you know, that day. And she said she wouldn't bless the marriage--
KRISTOFF => Wait. You got engaged to someone you just met?
ANNA => Yeah. Anyway, I got mad and so she got mad and then she tried to walk away, and I grabbed her glove--
KRISTOFF => Hang on. You mean to tell me you got engaged to someone you just met?! FROZEN - J. Lee
ANNA => Yes. Pay attention. But the thing is she wore the gloves all the time, so I just thought, maybe she has a thing about dirt.
KRISTOFF => Didn't your parents ever warn you about strangers?
ANNA => Yes, they did.... But Hans is not a stranger.
KRISTOFF => Oh yeah? What's his last name?
ANNA => ...Of-the-Southern-Isles?
KRISTOFF => What's his favorite food?
ANNA => ...Sandwiches.
KRISTOFF => Best friend's name?
ANNA => Probably John.
KRISTOFF => Eye color.
ANNA => Dreamy.
KRISTOFF => Foot size...?
ANNA => Foot size doesn't matter.
KRISTOFF => Have you had a meal with him yet? What if you hate the way he eats? What if you hate the way he picks his nose?
ANNA => Picks his nose? FROZEN - J. Lee
KRISTOFF => And eats it.
ANNA => Excuse me, sir. He's a prince.
KRISTOFF => All men do it.
ANNA => Ew. Look it doesn't matter; it's true love.
KRISTOFF => Doesn't sound like true love.
ANNA => Are you some sort of love expert?
KRISTOFF => No. But I have friends who are.
ANNA => You have friends who are love experts.... I'm not buying it.
KRISTOFF =>  Stop talking.
ANNA => No, no, no. I'd like to meet these--
KRISTOFF => I mean it. SHHH.
KRISTOFF => Sven, go. Go!
ANNA => What are they?
KRISTOFF => Wolves. FROZEN - J. Lee
ANNA => Wolves. What do we do?
KRISTOFF => I've got this. You just...don't fall off and don't get eaten.
ANNA => But I wanna help.
KRISTOFF => No.
ANNA => Why not?
KRISTOFF => Because I don't trust your judgement.
ANNA => Excuse me?!
KRISTOFF => Who marries a man she just met?
ANNA => It's true love!
KRISTOFF =>  Whoa.
ANNA => Christopher!
KRISTOFF => It's Kristoff! FROZEN - J. Lee
KRISTOFF => AH!
ANNA => Duck!
KRISTOFF => You almost set me on fire!
ANNA => But I didn't.
ANNA => Get ready to jump, Sven!
KRISTOFF => You don't tell him what to do!
KRISTOFF => I do!
KRISTOFF => Jump, Sven!
KRISTOFF =>  ...But I just paid it off.
KRISTOFF => Uh-oh. No, no, no.
KRISTOFF => AH! NO, NO, NO!
ANNA => Grab on!
ANNA => Pull, Sven! Pull!
ANNA => Whoa.... I'll replace your sled and everything in it.
ANNA => And I understand if you don't want to help me anymore.
KRISTOFF => Of course I don't want to help her anymore. In fact, this whole thing has ruined me for helping anyone ever again.
KRISTOFF => But she'll die on her own.
KRISTOFF => I can live with that. FROZEN - J. Lee
KRISTOFF => But you won't get your new sled if she's dead.
KRISTOFF =>  ...You know sometimes I really don't like you.
KRISTOFF =>  Hold up. We're coming?!
ANNA =>  You are?!  I mean, sure. I'll let you tag along.
ANNA => Arendelle.
KRISTOFF => It's completely frozen.
ANNA => ...But it'll be fine. Elsa will thaw it.
KRISTOFF => Will she? FROZEN - J. Lee
ANNA =>  ...Yeah. Now come on. This way to the North Mountain?
KRISTOFF => More like this way.
ANNA => I never knew winter could be so beautiful.
OLAF => YEAH...It really is beautiful, isn't it? But it's so white. You know, how about a little color? Must we bleach the joy out of it all? I'm thinking like maybe some crimson, chartreuse...
OLAF => How `bout yellow--no, not yellow. Yellow and snow? Brrrr...no go.
OLAF => Am I right? FROZEN - J. Lee
OLAF =>  Hi!
KRISTOFF => You're creepy.
ANNA => I don't want it!
KRISTOFF => Backatchya!
OLAF => Please don't drop me.
ANNA => Don't!
KRISTOFF => Come on, it's just a head.
ANNA => No!
OLAF => All right, we got off to a bad start.
ANNA => Ew, ew, the body!
OLAF => Wait, what am I looking at right now? Why are you hanging off the earth like a bat?
ANNA =>  ...Okay. Wait one second.
OLAF => Oooh! Thank you!
ANNA => You're welcome.
OLAF => Now I'm perfect.
ANNA => Well, almost.
OLAF => Woo! Head rush!
ANNA => Oh! Too hard. I'm sorry! I-I, I was just.... Are you okay?
OLAF => Are you kidding me? I am wonderful! I've always wanted a nose. (going cross-eyed to look at his tiny nose) So cute. It's like a little baby unicorn.
OLAF => What? Hey! Whoa.  Oh, I love it even more! Hah.... All right, let's start this thing over. Hi everyone. I'm Olaf. And I like warm hugs.
ANNA => Olaf?...That's right, Olaf. FROZEN - J. Lee
OLAF => ...And you are?
ANNA => Oh, um...I'm Anna.
OLAF => And who's the funky-looking donkey over there?
ANNA => That's Sven.
OLAF => Uh-huh. And who's the reindeer?
ANNA => ...Sven.
OLAF => Oh. They're--oh, okay....  Makes things easier for me.
OLAF => Ha. Aw, look at him tryin' to kiss my nose.  I like you, too!
ANNA => Olaf, did Elsa build you?
OLAF => Yeah. Why?
ANNA => Do you know where she is?
KRISTOFF =>  Fascinating...
OLAF => Yeah. Why? FROZEN - J. Lee
ANNA => Do you think you could show us the way?
OLAF => Yeah. Why?
KRISTOFF =>  How does this work?
OLAF => Stop it, Sven. Trying to focus here.  Yeah, why?
KRISTOFF => I'll tell you why. We need Elsa to bring back summer.
OLAF =>  Summer?  Oh, I don't know why but I've always loved the idea of summer, and sun, and all things hot.
KRISTOFF => Really? I'm guessing you don't have much experience with heat.
OLAF => Nope. But sometimes I like to close my eyes and imagine what it'd be like when summer does come.
OLAF => BEES'LL BUZZ / KIDS'LL BLOW DANDELION FUZZ / AND I'LL BE DOING WHATEVER SNOW DOES IN SUMMER. FROZEN - J. Lee
OLAF => A DRINK IN MY HAND / MY SNOW UP AGAINST THE BURNING SAND / PROB'LY GETTING GORGEOUSLY TANNED IN SUMMER.
OLAF => I'LL FINALLY SEE A SUMMER BREEZE / BLOW AWAY A WINTER STORM /
OLAF => AND FIND OUT WHAT HAPPENS TO SOLID WATER / WHEN IT GETS WARM.
OLAF => AND I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE / WHAT MY BUDDIES ALL THINK OF ME / JUST IMAGINE HOW MUCH COOLER I'LL BE IN SUMMER . . !
OLAF => DA DA . . . DA DOO / AH BAH BAH BAH BAH BAH BOO.
OLAF => THE HOT AND THE COLD ARE BOTH SO INTENSE / PUT `EM TOGETHER, IT JUST MAKES SENSE!
OLAF => RATDADAT DAD DADA DOO . . .
OLAF => WINTER'S A GOOD TIME TO STAY IN AND CUDDLE / BUT PUT ME IN SUMMER AND I'LL BE A...
OLAF => HAPPY SNOWMAN!
OLAF => WHEN LIFE GETS ROUGH I LIKE TO HOLD ON TO MY DREAM / OF RELAXING IN THE SUMMER SUN JUST LETTING OFF STEAM!
OLAF => OH THE SKY WILL BE BLUE / AND YOU GUYS'LL BE THERE TOO / WHEN I FINALLY DO WHAT FROZEN THINGS DO IN SUMMER!
KRISTOFF => I'm gonna tell him.
ANNA => Don't you dare.
OLAF => IN SUMMER!
OLAF => So, come on! Elsa's this way. Let's go bring back summer!
ANNA =>  I'm coming!
KRISTOFF => Somebody's got to tell him.
DISSOLVE TO => FROZEN - J. Lee
CITIZEN ONE => No. No. You've got the bark facing down. The bark needs to be face-up.
CITIZEN TWO => Bark down is drier.
CITIZEN ONE => Bark up.
CITIZEN TWO => Bark down.
CITIZEN ONE => Bark up.
HANS => Cloak. Does anyone need a cloak?
GERDA => Arendelle is indebted to you, Your Highness.
HANS => The castle is open. There's soup and hot glgg in the Great Hall.
HANS => Here. Pass these out.
DUKE => Prince Hans, are we just expected to sit here and freeze while you give away all of Arendelle's tradable goods?
HANS =>  Princess Anna has given her orders and-- FROZEN - J. Lee
DUKE => And that's another thing; has it dawned on you that your princess may be conspiring with a wicked sorceress to destroy us all?
HANS => Do not question the Princess. She left me in charge, and I will not hesitate to protect Arendelle from treason.
DUKE =>  Treason?!
HANS => Whoa! Whoa! Whoa, boy. Easy. Easy.
CROWD =>  Princess Anna's horse. What happened to her? Where is she?
HANS => ...Princess Anna is in trouble.  I need volunteers to go with me to find her!
DUKE => I volunteer two men, my Lord!  Be prepared for anything, and should you encounter the Queen, you are to put an end to this winter. Do you understand?
CUT TO => FROZEN - J. Lee
KRISTOFF => So how exactly are you planning to stop this weather?
ANNA =>  Oh, I am gonna talk to my sister.
KRISTOFF => That's your plan? My ice business is riding on you talking to your sister.
ANNA => Yup.
KRISTOFF => So you're not at all afraid of her?
ANNA => Why would I be?
OLAF =>  Yeah. I bet Elsa's the nicest, gentlest, warmest person ever.
OLAF => Oh, look at that. I've been impaled.
ANNA => What now? FROZEN - J. Lee
KRISTOFF => ...It's too steep. I've only got one rope, and you don't know how to climb mountains.
ANNA => Says who?
KRISTOFF =>  What are you doing?
ANNA =>  ...I'm going to see my sister.
KRISTOFF => You're going to kill yourself.
KRISTOFF => I wouldn't put my foot there.
ANNA => You're distracting me.
KRISTOFF => Or there. How do you know Elsa even wants to see you?
ANNA => I'm just blocking you out cause I gotta concentrate here.
KRISTOFF => You know, most people who disappear into the mountains want to be alone.
ANNA => Nobody wants to be alone. Except maybe you--
KRISTOFF => I'm not alone.... I have friends, remember?
ANNA => You mean the love experts?
KRISTOFF => Yes, the love experts!
ANNA => ...Please tell me I'm almost there.
ANNA => ...Does the air seem a bit thin to you up here?
KRISTOFF => Hang on.
OLAF => Hey, Sven? Not sure if this is going to solve the problem, but I found a staircase that leads exactly where you want it to go.
ANNA => Ha ha. Thank goodness. Catch!
ANNA => Thanks! That was like a crazy trust exercise.
ANNA => Whoa.
KRISTOFF =>  Now that's ice. I might cry. FROZEN - J. Lee
ANNA => Go ahead. I won't judge.
KRISTOFF => All right, take it easy. I gotcha.
KRISTOFF => You stay right here, buddy.
KRISTOFF => ...Flawless.
OLAF => ...Knock....  Just knock....  Why isn't she knocking...? Do you think she knows how to knock?
ANNA => Ha. It opened. That's a first.
ANNA => You should probably wait out here.
KRISTOFF => What?
ANNA => Last time I introduced her to a guy, she froze everything.
KRISTOFF => But, it's a palace made of ice. Ice is my life. FROZEN - J. Lee
OLAF => Bye, Sven.
ANNA => You too, Olaf.
OLAF => Me?
ANNA => Just give us a minute.
OLAF => Okay.
OLAF => One...two...
ANNA => Elsa? It's me...Anna?!
ELSA => Anna.
ANNA => Elsa, you look different.... It's a good different.... And this place is amazing. FROZEN - J. Lee
ELSA =>  Thank you, I never knew what I was capable of.
ANNA => ...I'm so sorry about what happened. If I'd known--
ELSA =>  No, it's okay. You don't have to apologize.... But you should probably go, please.
ANNA => But I just got here.
ELSA => ...You belong in Arendelle.
ANNA => So do you.
ELSA => No, I belong here. Alone. Where I can be who I am without hurting anybody.
ANNA => ...Actually, about that--
OLAF => 58...59...60.
ELSA => Wait. What is that?
OLAF => Hi, I'm Olaf and I like warm hugs.
ELSA =>  Olaf?
OLAF =>  You built me. You remember that?
ELSA =>  And you're alive?
OLAF => Um...I think so?
ANNA => He's just like the one we built as kids.... We were so close. We can be like that again.
YOUNG ELSA => Anna!
ELSA => No, we can't.
ELSA => Goodbye, Anna.
ANNA => Elsa, wait--
ELSA =>  I'm just trying to protect you.
ANNA => You don't have to protect me. I'm not afraid. Please don't shut me out again. FROZEN - J. Lee
ANNA => PLEASE DON'T SLAM THE DOOR. YOU DON'T HAVE TO KEEP YOUR DISTANCE ANYMORE.
FOREVER, => I FINALLY UNDERSTAND. FOR THE FIRST TIME IN FOREVER, WE CAN FIX THIS HAND IN HAND. WE CAN HEAD DOWN THIS MOUNTAIN TOGETHER. YOU DON'T HAVE TO LIVE IN FEAR. `CAUSE FOR THE FIRST TIME IN FOREVER, I WILL BE RIGHT HERE.
ELSA => Anna, PLEASE GO BACK HOME. YOUR LIFE AWAITS. GO ENJOY THE SUN AND OPEN UP THE GATES.
ANNA => Yeah, but--
ELSA => I know! YOU MEAN WELL, BUT LEAVE ME BE. YES, I'M ALONE BUT I'M ALONE AND FREE.
ELSA => JUST STAY AWAY AND YOU'LL BE SAFE FROM ME.
ANNA => ACTUALLY, WE'RE NOT.
ELSA => WHAT DO YOU MEAN YOU'RE NOT? FROZEN - J. Lee
ANNA => I GET THE FEELING YOU DON'T KNOW?
ELSA => WHAT DO I NOT KNOW?
ANNA => ARENDELLE'S IN DEEP DEEP DEEP DEEP SNOW.
ELSA => What?
ANNA => You kind of set off an eternal winter...everywhere.
ELSA => Everywhere?
ANNA => It's okay, you can just unfreeze it.
ELSA => No, I can't. I don't know how.
ANNA => Sure you can. I know you can.
ANNA => CUZ FOR THE FIRST TIME IN FOREVER,
ELSA =>  I'M SUCH A FOOL! I CAN'T BE FREE!
ANNA => YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE AFRAID.
ELSA => NO ESCAPE FROM THE STORM INSIDE OF ME!
ANNA => WE CAN WORK THIS OUT TOGETHER. FROZEN - J. Lee
ELSA => I CAN'T CONTROL THE CURSE!
ANNA => WE'LL REVERSE THE STORM YOU'VE MADE.
ELSA => ANNA, PLEASE, YOU'LL ONLY MAKE IT WORSE!
ANNA => DON'T PANIC.
ELSA => THERE'S SO MUCH FEAR!
ANNA => WE'LL MAKE THE SUN SHINE BRIGHT.
ELSA => YOU'RE NOT SAFE HERE!
ANNA => WE CAN FACE THIS THING TOGETHER...
ELSA => NO!
ANNA => WE CAN CHANGE THIS WINTER WEATHER, AND EVERYTHING WILL BE...
ELSA => I CAN'T!
KRISTOFF => Anna. Are you okay? FROZEN - J. Lee
ANNA => I'm okay.... I'm fine.
ELSA =>  Who's this? Wait, it doesn't matter. You have to go.
ANNA => No, I know we can figure this out together--
ELSA =>  How? What power do you have to stop this winter? To stop me?
KRISTOFF => Anna, I think we should go.
ANNA =>  No. I'm not leaving without you, Elsa.
ELSA =>  Yes, you are.
ANNA => Stop. Put us down!
OLAF =>  You are a lot stronger than I think you realize.
MARSHMALLOW =>  Go away!
OLAF => Heads up!
ANNA => Olaf!
OLAF => Watch out for my butt!
ANNA => It is not nice to throw people!
KRISTOFF                                   ANNA => All right feisty pants. Calm             Let me at him. I want to get down. Woaw. Just let the snow            him. I.... Okay. I'm Calm. man be.
KRISTOFF => Uh-oh. Now you made him mad!
OLAF => ...I'll distract him. You guys go.
OLAF => No, no, not you guys. FROZEN - J. Lee
OLAF =>  This just got a whole lot harder.
KRISTOFF => This way!
KRISTOFF =>  Ho-ho-ho!
ANNA => I got him!
KRISTOFF => Whoa, stop!
ANNA => It's a hundred foot drop.
KRISTOFF => It's two hundred.
ANNA => Ow.
ANNA => What's that for?
KRISTOFF => I'm digging a snow anchor. FROZEN - J. Lee
ANNA =>  Okay. What if we fall?
KRISTOFF => There's twenty feet of fresh powder down there; it'll be like landing on a pillow.... Hopefully.
KRISTOFF => Okay, Anna. On three.
ANNA => Okay. You tell me when...
KRISTOFF => One...
ANNA => ...I'm ready to go....
KRISTOFF => Two...
ANNA =>  ...I was BORN ready! Yes!
KRISTOFF => Calm down.
ANNA => TREE!
KRISTOFF => Whoa! That happened.
OLAF => Ah. Ah. Man, am I out of shape. FROZEN - J. Lee
OLAF => There we go. Hey, Anna! Sven! Where'd ya guys go? We totally lost Marshmallow back there!
OLAF =>  Hey. We were just talking about you. All good things, all good things.
OLAF => NO!
OLAF => This is not making much of a difference!
OLAF => WHOA!
ANNA => Olaf!
OLAF => Hang in there, guys!
ANNA => Wait, what?
KRISTOFF => Aargghh!
ANNA => Kristoff! FROZEN - J. Lee
MARSHMALLOW => Don't come back!
ANNA =>  Ugh. We won't.
ANNA => Hey, you were right. Just like a pillow.
OLAF =>  I can't feel my legs! I can't feel my legs!
KRISTOFF => Those are my legs.
OLAF =>  Ooh. Hey, do me a favor, grab my butt.
OLAF => Oh, that feels better.
OLAF => Hey, Sven! FROZEN - J. Lee
OLAF => He found us.  Who's my cute little reindeer?
KRISTOFF => Don't talk to him like that.
KRISTOFF => Here.
ANNA =>  Whoa!
KRISTOFF => You okay?
ANNA => Thank you.
ANNA => ...Um.... How's your head?
KRISTOFF =>  Ah! Ooh!
KRISTOFF => I mean, It's fine. Ah...I'm good. Ha. I've got a thick skull.
OLAF => I don't have a skull.... Or bones.
KRISTOFF => ...So....
KRISTOFF =>  Now what?
ANNA =>  Now what?  Now what?! Oh! What am I gonna do? She threw me out. I can't go back to Arendelle with the weather like this. And then there's your ice business--
KRISTOFF => Hey, hey, don't worry about my ice business...  Worry about your hair?!
ANNA => What? I just fell off a cliff. You should see your hair.
KRISTOFF => No, yours is turning white.
ANNA => White? It's what?
KRISTOFF => It's because she struck you; isn't it?
ANNA => Does it look bad?
KRISTOFF =>  ...No.
OLAF => You hesitated.
KRISTOFF => No, I didn't. Anna, you need help. Now, come on. FROZEN - J. Lee
OLAF => Okay! Where are we going?
KRISTOFF => To see my friends.
ANNA =>  The love experts?
OLAF => Love experts?!
KRISTOFF => Yes. And don't worry; they'll be able to fix this.
ANNA => How do you know?
KRISTOFF => ...Because I've seen them do it before.
OLAF => I like to consider myself a love expert.
ELSA =>  Get it together. Control it. Don't feel. Don't feel. Don't FEEL!
DISSOLVE TO => FROZEN - J. Lee
OLAF => Look, Sven. The sky's awake.
KRISTOFF => Are you cold?
ANNA => ...A little.
KRISTOFF => Wait. Come here.
ANNA => Oooh.... That's nice.
KRISTOFF =>  So, about my friends...well, I say friends, they're more like family.... Anyway, when I was a kid, it was just me and Sven...until they took me in.
ANNA =>  They did?
KRISTOFF =>  Yeah. I don't want to scare you, they can be a little bit inappropriate...and loud...very loud...they're also stubborn at times, and a little overbearing. And heavy. Really, really heavy.  FROZEN - J. Lee
KRISTOFF => But they're fine.. You'll get it. They mean well.
ANNA => Kristoff, they sound wonderful.
KRISTOFF => Okay then....
KRISTOFF => Meet my family.
KRISTOFF =>  Hey, guys!
ANNA =>  ...They're rocks.
OLAF =>  He's crazy.  I'll distract them while you run.  Hi, Sven's family! It's nice to meet you!  Anna, because I love you, I insist you run.  I understand you're love experts!  Why aren't you running?
ANNA => Okay. Um...I'm gonna go--
ANNA =>  Kristoff!
BULDA => KRISTOFF'S HOME!
TROLLS => Kristoff! Kristoff's home! It's been too long! Kristoff's home!
OLAF =>  Kristoff's home.
OLAF => Wait? Kristoff?
TROLL ONE => Oh, lemme look at you!
TROLL TWO => Oh, take off your clothes, Kristoff; I wash them.
KRISTOFF =>  Ah! No. I'm gonna keep my clothes on, thank you.
KRISTOFF => Great to see you all. Where's grandpa?
ANNA => Trolls? They're trolls.
BULDA => ...He's brought a girl!
TROLLS => He's brought a girl!
ANNA => What's going on?
KRISTOFF => I've learned to just roll with it.
BULDA => Let me see. Bright eyes. Working nose. Strong teeth. Yes, yes, yes. She'll do nicely for our Kristoff.
ANNA => Wait. Oh. Um. No.
KRISTOFF => You've got the wrong idea. That's not why I brought her here.
ANNA => Right. We're not. I'm not--
BULDA =>  What's the issue, dear? Why are you holding back from such a man?
TROLLS => IS IT THE CLUMPY WAY HE WALKS? OR THE GRUMPY WAY HE TALKS? OR THE PEAR-SHAPED, SQUARE-SHAPED WEIRDNESS OF HIS FEET? AND THOUGH WE KNOW HE WASHES WELL HE ALWAYS ENDS UP SORTA SMELLY. BUT YOU'LL NEVER MEET A FELLA WHO'S AS SENSITIVE AND SWEET.
TROLLS => SO HE'S A BIT OF A FIXER UPPER, SO HE'S GOT A FEW FLAWS- HIS PECULIAR BRAIN, DEAR. HIS THING FOR THE REINDEER THAT OUTSIDE A FEW OF NATURE'S LAWS. SO HE'S A BIT OF A FIXER UPPER, BUT THIS WE'RE CERTAIN OF- YOU CAN FIX THIS FIXER UPPER UP WITH A LITTLE BIT OF LOVE.
KRISTOFF => Can we just stop talking about this?! We've got a real, actual problem here.
BULDA => I'll say--  IS IT THE WAY THAT HE RUNS SCARED?
TROLLS => OR THAT HE'S SOCIALLY IMPAIRED?
KID TROLL => OR THAT HE ONLY LIKES TO TINKLE IN THE WOODS?
TROLLS => ARE YOU HOLDING BACK YOUR FONDNESS DUE TO HIS UNMANLY BLONDENESS? OR THE WAY HE COVERS UP THAT HE'S THE HONEST GOODS? FROZEN - J. Lee
TROLLS => HE'S JUST A BIT OF A FIXER UPPER- HE'S GOT A COUPLE A' BUGS.
KRISTOFF => No, I don't.
TROLLS => HIS ISOLATION IS CONFIRMATION OF HIS DESPERATION FOR HEALING HUGS. SO HE'S A BIT OF A FIXER UPPER, BUT WE KNOW WHAT TO DO. THE WAY TO FIX UP THIS FIXER UPPER IS TO FIX HIM UP WITH YOU.
KRISTOFF =>  Enough! She's engaged to someone else. Okay?!
TROLLS => SO SHE'S A BIT OF A FIXER UPPER, THAT'S A MINOR THING. THIS QUOTE "ENGAGEMENT" IS A FLEX ARRANGEMENT.
KID TROLL => AND BY THE WAY, I DON'T SEE NO RING.
TROLLS => SO SHE'S A BIT OF A FIXER UPPER, HER BRAIN'S A BIT BETWIXT. GET THE FIANCE OUT OF THE WAY AND THE WHOLE THING WILL BE FIXED!
GIRL TROLLS => WE AREN'T SAYING YOU CAN CHANGE HIM
TROLLS => 'CAUSE PEOPLE DON'T REALLY CHANGE. WE'RE ONLY SAYING THAT LOVE'S A FORCE THAT'S POWERFUL AND STRANGE. PEOPLE MAKE BAD CHOICES IF THEY'RE MAD OR SCARED OR STRESSED.  FROZEN - J. Lee
TROLLS => BUT THROW A LITTLE LOVE THEIR WAY  AND YOU'LL BRING OUT THEIR BEST! TRUE LOVE BRINGS OUT THE BEST!
ALL TROLLS => EVERYONE'S A BIT OF A FIXER UPPER, THAT'S WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT FATHER, SISTER, BROTHER WE NEED EACH OTHER TO RAISE US UP AND ROUND US OUT
TROLLS => EVERYONE'S A BIT OF A FIXER UPPER, BUT WHEN PUSH COMES TO SHOVE- THE ONLY FIXER UPPER FIXER THAT CAN FIX A FIXER UPPER IS TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE LOVE
TROLL PRIEST => Do you, Anna, take Kristoff to be your trollfully wedded--
ANNA => Wait, what?!
TROLL PRIEST => You're getting married.
TROLLS => LOVE!
KRISTOFF => Anna?
KRISTOFF => She's as cold as ice.
GRAND PABBIE => There's strange magic here!
KRISTOFF => Grand Pabbie!
GRAND PABBIE => Bring her to me, Kristoff.
GRAND PABBIE => Anna, your life is in danger. There is ice in your heart, put there by your sister. If not removed, to solid ice will you freeze, forever.
ANNA => What...? No.
KRISTOFF => So remove it, Grand Pabbie.
GRAND PABBIE => I can't. If it was her head, that would be easy. But only an act of true love can thaw a frozen heart.
ANNA => An act of true love?
BULDA =>  A true love's kiss, perhaps?
KRISTOFF => Anna, we've got to get you back to Hans.
ANNA =>  ...Hans. FROZEN - J. Lee
KRISTOFF => Help us out, Sven.
KRISTOFF => Come on, Olaf!
OLAF => I'm coming! Let's go kiss Hans! Who is this Hans?!
HANS => We are here to find Princess Anna. Be on guard, but no harm is to come to the Queen. Do you understand?
MARSHMALLOW => Go away!
DUKE'S THUG => The Queen.
ELSA =>  No. Please.
ELSA => Stay away!
THUG => Get her! Get her!
HANS => Queen Elsa! Don't be the monster they fear you are.
ELSA => No....What have I done?
ELSA => Why did you bring me here?
HANS => I couldn't just let them kill you. FROZEN - J. Lee
ELSA => But I'm a danger to Arendelle. Get Anna.
HANS => Anna has not returned....
HANS => If you would just stop the winter, bring back summer...please.
ELSA => Don't you see...I can't.
ELSA => You have to tell them to let me go.
HANS => I will do what I can.
KRISTOFF => Just hang in there.  Come on, buddy, faster!
OLAF => I'll meet you guys at the castle! FROZEN - J. Lee
KRISTOFF => Stay out of sight, Olaf!
OLAF => I will!
OLAF => Hello!
TOWNSWOMAN => Ah! It's alive!
GUARD => It's Princess Anna!
KRISTOFF => I've got you.
ANNA => ...Are you g-gonna be okay?
KRISTOFF =>  Don't worry about me.
GERDA => Anna! Oh, you had us worried sick.
KAI => My Lady. You are freezing.
GERDA => You poor girl, you're freezing. Let's get you inside. FROZEN - J. Lee
KRISTOFF => Get her warm and find Prince Hans, immediately.
KAI => We will. Thank you.
KRISTOFF => Make sure she's safe!
HANS => I'm going back out to look for Princess Anna.
FRENCH DIGNITARY => You cannot risk going out there again.
HANS => If anything happens to her--
SPANISH DIGNITARY => If anything happens to the Princess, you are all Arendelle has left.
KAI => He's in here. Prince Hans.
HANS => Anna. FROZEN - J. Lee
HANS => You're so cold.
ANNA =>  Hans, you have to kiss me.
HANS => What?
ANNA => Now. Here we go.
GERDA => We'll give you two some privacy.
HANS => What happened out there?
ANNA => Elsa struck me with her powers.
HANS => You said she'd never hurt you.
ANNA => I was wrong.
HANS => Anna.
ANNA =>  She froze my heart and only an act of true love can save me.
HANS =>  A true love's kiss.
HANS => Oh, Anna. If only there was someone out there who loved you.
ANNA => What?
ANNA => ...You said you did.
HANS => As thirteenth in line in my own kingdom, I didn't stand a chance. I knew I'd have to marry into the throne somewhere--
ANNA => What are you talking about?
HANS =>  As heir, Elsa was preferable, of course. But no one was getting anywhere with her. But you-
ANNA => Hans?
HANS => You were so desperate for love you were willing to marry me, just like that.
HANS => I figured, after we married, I'd have to stage a little accident for Elsa.
ANNA => Hans. No, stop. FROZEN - J. Lee
HANS => But then she doomed herself, and you were dumb enough to go after her.
ANNA => Please.
HANS =>  All that's left now is to kill Elsa and bring back summer.
ANNA => ...You're no match for Elsa.
HANS => No, you're no match for Elsa. I, on the other hand, am the hero who is going to save Arendelle from destruction.
ANNA =>  You won't get away with this.
HANS => Oh, I already have.
ANNA =>  Please, somebody help.
CUT TO => FROZEN - J. Lee
DUKE => It's getting colder by the minute. If we don't do something soon, we'll all freeze to death.
SPANISH DIGNITARY => Prince Hans.
HANS => Princess Anna is...dead.
VARIOUS DIGNITARIES => What...? No.... Mon dieu.
DUKE => What happened to her?
HANS => She was killed by Queen Elsa.
DUKE => Her own sister.
HANS =>  At least we got to say our marriage vows...before she died in my arms.
DUKE => There can be no doubt now; Queen Elsa is a monster and we are all in grave danger.
SPANISH DIGNITARY => Prince Hans, Arendelle looks to you.
HANS => With a heavy heart, I charge Queen Elsa of Arendelle with treason and sentence her to death.
GUARD => She's dangerous. Move quickly and with resolve.
KRISTOFF => What is it, buddy?
KRISTOFF => Hey, watch it. What's wrong with you?
KRISTOFF =>  ...I don't understand you when you talk like that. FROZEN - J. Lee
KRISTOFF => Ah! Stop it! Put me down!
KRISTOFF => No, Sven! We're not going back!
KRISTOFF => She's with her true love.
KRISTOFF => Anna.
ANNA =>  Help.
OLAF => Anna. Oh no.
ANNA => Olaf? Olaf. Get away from there.
OLAF => Whoa! So this is heat....  I love it.
OLAF => Ooh! But don't touch it!
OLAF => So, where's Hans? What happened to your kiss?
ANNA => I was wrong about him. It wasn't true love.
OLAF =>  Huh. But we ran all the way here?
ANNA => Please Olaf, you can't stay here; you'll melt.
OLAF => I am not leaving here until we find some other act of true love to save you.
OLAF => ...Do you happen to have any ideas?
ANNA => I don't even know what love is.
OLAF =>  That's okay, I do....
OLAF => Love is...putting someone else's needs before yours, like, you know, how Kristoff brought you back here to Hans and left you forever.
ANNA => ...Kristoff loves me?
OLAF => Wow, you really don't know anything about love, do you?
ANNA => Olaf, you're melting.
OLAF =>  Some people are worth melting for.
OLAF => Just maybe not right this second.
OLAF => Don't worry, I've got it!
OLAF =>  We're going to get through--  Oh, wait. Hang on. I'm getting something.
OLAF => It's Kristoff and Sven! They're coming back this way.
ANNA => ...They-they are? FROZEN - J. Lee
OLAF => Wow, he's really moving fast. Huh.... I guess I was wrong. I guess Kristoff doesn't love you enough to leave you behind.
ANNA => Help me up, Olaf. Please.
OLAF => No, no, no, no, no. You need to stay by the fire and keep warm.
ANNA => I need to get to Kristoff.
OLAF =>  Why...?  Oh, oh, oh, I know why.
OLAF => There's your act of true love, right there, riding across the fjords like a valiant, pungent reindeer king! Come on!
OLAF => Look out!
OLAF => We're trapped.
OLAF => Slide, Anna.
OLAF => We made it!
KRISTOFF => Come on, buddy, faster.
ANNA => Kristoff!
OLAF => Keep going, Anna!
ANNA => Kristoff!
KRISTOFF => Come on! Come on!
KRISTOFF => Sven? Sven!
KRISTOFF => Good boy.
ANNA => Kristoff.
KRISTOFF => Anna...? Anna!
HANS => Elsa. You can't run from this!
ELSA => ...Just take care of my sister.
HANS => Your sister? She returned from the mountain weak and cold. She said you froze her heart.
ELSA => What? No.
HANS => I tried to save her, but it was too late. Her skin was ice. Her hair turned white...
HANS => Your sister is dead... because of you.
ANNA =>  Kristoff.
KRISTOFF => Anna.
ANNA => Elsa.
ANNA => No!
ELSA => Anna!
ELSA => Oh, Anna...no...no, please no.
OLAF =>  Anna?
ELSA => Wha-? Anna?
ANNA => Oh, Elsa.
They embrace. => FROZEN - J. Lee
ELSA => ...You sacrificed yourself for me?
ANNA =>  ...I love you.
OLAF => An act of true love will thaw a frozen heart.
ELSA =>  Love...will thaw...  Love.... Of course.
ANNA => Elsa?
ELSA => Love.
ANNA => I knew you could do it.
OLAF =>  Hands down, this is the best day of my life...and quite possibly the last.
ELSA => Oh, Olaf. Hang on, little guy. FROZEN - J. Lee
OLAF => Hey, my own personal flurry.
ANNA => Uh. Uh. Uh.
HANS =>  Anna? But she froze your heart.
ANNA => The only frozen heart around here is yours.
HANS => Ah! Whoa, whoa, whoa!
FRENCH DIGNITARY =>  I will return this scoundrel to his country. We shall see what his twelve big brothers think of his behavior.
KAI => Arendelle thanks you, my Lord. FROZEN - J. Lee
DUKE => This is unacceptable. I am innocent. I'm a victim of fear. I've been traumatized.  Ow! My neck hurts. Is there a doctor I could...No? And I demand to see the Queen!
KAI => I have a message from the Queen.  Arendelle will henceforth and forever no longer do business of any sort with Weaseltown.
DUKE => Weselton. It's Weselton!
ANNA => Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on!
KRISTOFF => Pole.
ANNA => Oops. Sorry.
ANNA =>  Okay. Okay. Here we are. FROZEN - J. Lee
ANNA => I owe you a sled.
KRISTOFF =>  Are you serious?
ANNA => Yes. And it's the latest model.
KRISTOFF => No. I can't accept this...
ANNA => You have to. No returns. No exchanges. Queen's orders. She's named you the official Arendelle Ice Master and Deliverer.
KRISTOFF => What? That's not a thing.
ANNA => Sure it is. And it even has a cup holder.... Do you like it?
KRISTOFF => Like it?
KRISTOFF => I love it.... I could kiss you!
KRISTOFF => ...I could. I mean I'd like to. I'd... may I? We me....I mean, may we? Wait, what?
ANNA => We may. FROZEN - J. Lee
ELSA => Are you ready?
ANNA => I like the open gates.
ELSA => We are never closing them again.
ANNA => What? Oh, Elsa, they're beautiful, but you know I don't ska--
KRISTOFF => Look out. Reindeer coming through! FROZEN - J. Lee
OLAF => That's it. Glide and pivot and glide and pivot.
