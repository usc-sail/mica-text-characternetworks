VOMIT => Wha-at!... No, no, I can't do it tomorrow.  I'm taping a Rock Against Drugs spot.  It's important to me...
PILOT => Five minutes, Mister Vomit.
VOMIT => Thanks, man... Don't worry, Johnny, I have it with me now.  I'll just put it in a little protection program. He can't stop us, man, no way.
ZUZU => Peek-a-boo!
VOMIT => Now, Zuzu, didn't I tell you to lay off the coolers?
ZUZU => So I had this dream, right.  You guys were doing that song, 'I Love You More Than My Own Death,' right, when all of a sudden these penguins come on stage and tell the audience that I used to wet my bed.  And that I enjoyed it.  It was so real ... How 'bout a kiss, Bobby?
VOMIT =>  Sure.  Babe.
GRENDEL => Vomit.  Vomit.  Vomit.
GRENDEL => Nice of you to drop by, Mister Vomit.
VOMIT => Please don't spank me, Mister Grendel.
VOMIT => Drown in hell, you deaf motherfucker!
GRENDEL => Sticks and stones...
VOMIT => But I thought you couldn't hear?
GRENDEL => Oh Robert , you're so predictable, I don't have to.
VOMIT => Let's do it, man.
ANNOUNCER => Welcome, sluts and perverts, I give you, Black Vomit!
VOMIT =>  Hello, L.A.
DOORMAN => You people are disgusting.  Don't you remember the Roman empire?
JAIME => Guy's a rock star who don't play a note of music.  Carries a gun instead of a guitar... Am I right, Larry?
LARRY => Wasn't always a detective though, Jaime.  Started out doing every shit job in the biz; chauffeur, roadie, publicist, Phil Spector's bodyguard...
FORD => Hey, Spike, I was sorry to hear about your cat.  Those U.P.S. trucks are pretty wicked.
DOORMAN => Thanks, man.
FORD => If you need somebody to talk to...
CLUB GAL => You son-of-a-bitch!
FORD => Whoa.  Another satisfied customer.
BOUNCER => Ford, I gotta ask you to put that out, dude.  Nobody smokes anymore.
TWIN SISTER => What goes for my sister, goes double for me.  Don't you remember the Jacuzzi, Laurel Canyon, the Guns and Roses video wrap party.
FORD =>  Yeah, yeah... but you weren't identical.
TWIN SISTER => You said you'd call us...
FORD => Let me give you my number, it's 555-6023.
TWIN SISTER => Thanks!  Wait.  555's not a real number.  They only use it in the movies...
FORD => What in the fuck do you think this is?  Real life?
LARRY => Yeah, well, just don't call him Mr. Rock-N-Roll Detective...
FORD =>  You two loony guys, what are your names?  Neal and Bob?  Or is that what you do?  Tell me, are you driving home tonight?
FORD => Go-o-o-d... Don!
FORD => So many assholes, so few bullets.
DON => Damn, Ford, you're the most cynical man in the industry and that's not easy.
FORD => I'm not cynical.  Can I help it that life is a disease and everyone's a victim. So you're producing exclusively for Grendel Records now.  Hope you're taking Julian for a bundle.
DON => Man, ever since old Jack Grendel died, Julian has got me into one yummy gig after the other.  Not only am I producing, he's got me in some lovely-bullshit-money-money executive position.  What are you looking at...
FORD => Some redhead's been harassing that all-girl group, the Ovaries. Hanging out at their concerts saying he wants to rape and kill them and not in that order.  Cops won't do anything until he actually does something.
MELODI => You're that guy, the private eye.
FORD => You're a poet and didn't know it.
MELODI => Do you really know everybody in the industry?
FORD => Only on a first name basis.
MELODI => That's cute.  You're funny.
FORD => That's funny, you're cute.
MELODI => You heard that Bobby Vomit O.D.'d, right?  Do you suspect foul play and stuff?
FORD => I'll tell you when somebody pays me to give a shit and stuff.
MELODI => My name's Melodi, as in 'a pretty girl is like a.'  Whatever you're doing tomorrow... cancel.
DON => You gotta shave before you leave the house in a dress like that and I don't mean your legs.  Why didn't you jump on her?  What's happening to you?
FORD => I guess I'm not interested in any club who'll have my member as a member.  Later, Don...
LARRY => You better have that vodka milkshake done.  Here comes Mr. Rock-N-Roll Detec -- Hi, Ford.
FORD => Not thick enough, but better.  You're definitely getting better, Harry. (turning to Jaime and Larry) Hey, if it isn't Mutt... and Mutt. Who's your friend?
JAIME => Just some guy named Sam...
FORD => Reminds me of that song by the all- girl group, the Ovaries, 'Some Guys Eat Reindeer.'  What.  A. Tune!  But what's that lead singer's name.  I'm drawing a fucking blank here...
FORD => Shall we da-ance?
FORD => So finally got a tip that paid off.  Why can't you sleazebags who harass women take 'no' for an answer?  I mean, hey, it's never happened to me personally...
FORD =>  Great.
FORD => You're ten seconds away from the most embarrassing moment in your life.
DON => Come on Ford, this shit's getting old.
FORD => Clint Eastwood... I fucked him.
FORD => Jesus, Jazz, I'm coming.  So I'm late.  I go to work when you go to bed.
THE KID => Fairlane, you gonna find out who killed the lead singer of Black Vomit?
FORD => Tell me, Dr. Watson, what makes you think he's not just another piece of shit overdose.
THE KID => Gut feeling.
FORD => I'll give you a gut feeling, you little... Hey... hey!  Get that stick out of your mouth.  These things are killers, man.  Don't you go to school, listen to Smokey the Bear and all that...
FORD => Bone appetit.
THE KID => When you going to let me work with you?  Why you always fucking with me?
FORD => Why am I what?  Excuse me?  I catch you saying the F-word again.  I'll kill you.  That's a fucking promise.  Now get the fuck out of here.
THE KID => I got something serious to dis-cuss.
FORD => Well what is it?  I'm not Kreskin.
THE KID => Forget it.
JAZZ => Good morning she said as the clock struck five.  I sent the Ovaries down for food.  They've been waiting for hours...
FORD => Your tip paid off.  Jazz, this is Sam the Sleazebag.  Sam the Sleazebag, this is Jazz, my secretary.
JAZZ => Assistant.  And don't call me Jazz.
FORD => All your friends call you Jazz.
JAZZ => Exactly.
JZAA => Hey, IN X S paid today.  Their 'payment' is around here somewhere.
FORD => They paid?  I love Australia! What a band!  Let's throw a Foster's on the barbie and call up me mates... Cash or check?
JAZZ =>  You wish.
FORD => Cash or check, Jazz?  Don't do this to me.
OVARY ONE => Hey, Ford, little late.
OVARY TWO => That's him!  That's the bastard. He flashed us at the Ampitheatre.
OVARY THREE => I think I could identify it.  It looked like a dick.  Only smaller.
FORD => We could gab about evidence and restraining orders all day, but I think castration is really the way to go.  May get a wee messy...
FORD => It's a new by-law for pathetic jerks who harass women.
OVARY FOUR => Do we get to keep it?
FORD => Of course.  Every girl should have one.
FORD => Next time, it'll be your burrito.
FORD => I doubt he'll be hassling you anymore, but hey, I'll save the hedgeclippers anyway.
OVARY ONE => Great job, Ford.  Take this.  As payment.  It's solid gold and it'll make sure you're not late for your other clients.
FORD => No really.  Money is fine.
OVARY TWO => Great gift idea, Stace.
FORD => But...
OVARIES => 'Bye, Ford...
FORD => I do it for love.
JAZZ => 'Bye Ford...'  Hey, let me cheer you up.  I found the IN X S payment.
JAZZ => G'day, they say it's worth three grand...
FORD => Fucking Australians!  I hate that country, continent, what is it? Don't we do nuclear testing there?
JAZZ => Let's just declare war on the hellhole.  Before they make Crocodile Dundee three.
FORD => Rock stars!  I'm going out of my mind.  All I get are perks.  I don't make money, I make gifts. How am I supposed to pay taxes with bathtub compact disc players and autographed drumsticks.  I want cash.  Moulah.  Wampum.  Dead Presidents.  Andrew Jackson. Gerald Ford.
JAZZ => You're saying you need money.
FORD => Car insurance costs money. Cavities cost money.  Doritos cost money.  I'm gonna eat that damn bear... come here!
JAZZ => Quit crying.  I think we've got a case if we can make it through the cavalcade of bimbos, here...
SQUEAKY BIMBO =>  Hi, this is Vikki, you know, Vikki. I figured you probably washed off my phone number before you had a...
JAZZ =>  Bim-bo.
FORD => Cut the play by play.
OBNOXIOUS D.J. => This Chevy Nova?  Chevy Nova, there?  Huh?  Huh?  Johnny Crunch, K.O.D.S. , you schmuck? You know the guy who had sex with your prom date before the prom and needless to say before he became the hottest D.J. in the West.  I gotta case for you, man.  Come down to the station about six.
FORD => Johnny Pinzolo calling himself Johnny Crunch.  Knock me out.  We grew up together in Brooklyn. Came out here to be rock stars... Of course, he's lying about the prom date thing, at least I hope he is, I took his sister.
JAZZ =>  You're friends with the most obnoxious asshole on the airwaves. The King of the Shock Jocks.  I'm, I'm shocked.
FORD => I love you, too, baby.  He wants to meet at six.  What time is it now?
JAZZ => Six.  Take it, you need it.
FORD => K-O-D-S is going to make me rich!
JAZZ => That's for me... Radio contests, really Ford, how tacky...
FORD =>  Ah -- ha... You know, you should think about dating Earthmen again.
JAZZ => So what about this watch?
FORD => Keep it.  It's your paycheck this month.
JOHNY => Ye-e-e-a-a-ah!
JOHNNY => Nothing like a tender ballad sung by a girl pretending to be a virgin. I'm sorry, young girls should not be out making records; they should be in, setting records making out. Naked.  On my coffee table.  Are you offended?  Well, slurp this...
FORD => I'm here to see Johnny.
RECEPTIONIST => Lucky you.  Arnie... Mr. Crunch has a lot of fans who hate his guts.
FORD => Oh, Arnie, sometimes when we touch, the honesty's too much.
JOHNNY => And don't forget, if we call and you answer the phone 'K-O-D-S is going to make me rich,' you could win a cool million.  Sexually transmittable disease jokes are coming up next hour so go get your mom.  Better yet, I'll get her...
FORD => I don't believe it.  Getting paid to be the asshole you always were.
JOHNNY => Fucking amazing, huh?  Chevy Nova, you Bensonhurst shit!  Still in La-la land.  Look at us, two rock 'n' roll dicks.  Unfortunately, only one of us is a detective.
FORD => Nice getting all those phone calls from you after you hit it big, you Redhook bastard.
JOHNNY => I don't remember any Arbor Day cards from Mr. Rock 'n' Roll Detective.
FORD => Friendship's a lot different out here.  A wrong number is a relationship.  But then this isn't a social call.
FORD => How nice.
JOHNNY => It's my daughter, man.  I know I never told you about her, but God, I love that girl.  She calls herself Zuzu Petals and she's been swallowed up by the gorgeous hell that is L.A. A fucking groupie partying with the pros.  You have to get my baby back, she's my pride and --
FORD => 'Bye, Johnny...
JOHNNY => What?
ENGINEER => Dead air, Johnny...
JOHNNY => Will you people leave me alone! I'm contemplating my life and you just won't stop listening!  Here's five in a row played at the wrong speed.
JOHNNY => So...
FORD => I don't take cases with foundations in bullshit.  They are very hard to walk around in.
JOHNNY => Just find her, man.  She's my daughter, she's my sister, she's my mother, she's some little brat I stood in line with at Taco Bell last week.  Do whatever you want with my words.  And my money.
JOHNNY => I am told it is difficult to pay the phone bill with gold chains and V.C.R.s.  There's four thousand here.
FORD => Zuzu Petals.  Sounds like a drug. A lethal one.
JOHNNY => I hope you solve the case and I know you will, because you're the best.  Ford, guys like you don't grow on trees.
JOHNNY => Here's to you...
JOHNNY => No dessert until you've finished dinner.
FEEBLE WOMAN => Johnny, why can't you play different kinds of music?
JOHNNY => I think the real question here, ma'am, is 'Are you wearing panties?'  A-a-a-h!
FORD => Why did I take it?  Because he's my friend.  But I never liked the bastard.  Why did I say yes?  Four thousand reasons.  Right, buddy?
FORD => There are 5,000 private investigators in L.A.  It made sense to specialize.  Why did I pick the music industry?  Why not fishermen?  Fishermen get up, fish, sell the fish, then go to bed so they can get up and fish. How hard can the cases be:  'Ford, somebody switched the lures in my fucking tackle box.'  'Ford, my bait's been sabotaged.'
JOHNNY =>  Well, it's time to sign off.  I know I get on the radio and say a lot of harsh things but I want you to know, deep down, I hate you, each and every one of you, so until tomorrow, burn in...
JOHNNY => Oh, my god, somebody just shot my engineer!  Oh, hey, they're doing something with my mike! Hey, I'm being electrocuted! And it hurts!
FORD => Call the police!  Johnny's being electrocuted!
RECEPTIONIST => Oh, please.  He's just doing one of his little jokes...
FORD => Look at the lights...
JOHNNY =>  Oh-fucking-shit-my-Christ-I'm- dying!
RECEPTIONIST => Hey, he can't say 'oh-fucking- shit-my-Christ-I'm-dying' over the air!
DETECTIVE => Well, I hope this guy signed your yearbook because it looks like your friendship, and your case, is closed.
FORD => I think I'm going to cry.
DETECTIVE =>  Crying's good, Ford.  Crying's good.
LT. AMOS => How'd Mr. Rock 'n' Roll Detective boogie his way in here?  Anybody...
DETECTIVE => He discovered the body, Lt. Amos, sir.
FORD => Nice tie, Lt. Anus, sir.
LT. AMOS => You think you're so hot just because you can get into any club. You think you're so hot, just because you have sex with great- looking women.  You think you're so hot just because you broke the Ensenada tape piracy ring...
FORD => You gotta admit those are all pretty great reasons...
LT. AMOS => Get the fuck out of here, honey... What do we got?
DETECTIVE => This guy was hated by everyone. He offended every race, religion, and sexual preference imaginable. He even said the Lakers suck. So basically we're looking at everyone from the Glendale Skinheads to Magic Johnson.
LT. AMOS => What are you running from?
FORD => Why shucks, Lt. Anus, you told me to get the fuck out of here...
LT. AMOS => If you're hiding something... oh, oh, I'll have so much fun.
FORD => Why do you hate me?  It's gotta be more than Me Private You, You Cop.
LT. AMOS =>  Two words.  Disco Express.
FORD => Disco Ex -- man, that group sucked like a squid, they had some shitty single they wanted me to plug, back in my publicist days...
LT. AMOS => 'Booty Time.'
FORD => Yeah, and that lead singer, Jesus, that white Van McCoy wanna-be with the six-inch platform shoes. He looked...
LT. AMOS => Like me.
FORD => I was about to say he looked like shit, but hey, sure, he looked like you.
LT. AMOS => 'It's booty time, it's booty time, across the U.S.A.  It's booty time...'
FORD => You were the lead sing -- Lieutenant, I didn't think anyone could cheer me up tonight... Thanks.  Really.
THE KID => Ouch.
FORD => Hey, you, get off my cloud.  I'm talking to my friend.  1962 Fender Stratocaster with original humbucking pick-ups, maple neck, strung upside down for a left- handed motherfucking genius... Jimi Hendrix.
THE KID => Who cares?  I got a case.
FORD => Twelve pack?
THE KID => This ain't no social call.  One hundred bucks.  To find my father.
FORD =>  Did he just say what I think he said?
THE KID => I've got a clue.  Look at my ring. Before my old lady ran off to Baja, she told me my dad had this same ring.
FORD => Holy Colonel Mustard.  Gosh, you didn't mention the big clue... Kid, I can't take your money.
THE KID => You need it.
FORD => I don't need it that bad.
FORD => I don't believe it.  I took the money.
COLLEEN => Ford Fairlane, I'm Colleen Sutton and I need your help.  I have a problem and it pertains to the music industry.  What is it they call you?  Mr. Rock and...
FORD => Don't say it.  Orange juice?
COLLEEN => Please.
FORD => Sorry about the glass.  And the house.  And the breath.
COLLEEN => Mr. Fairlane, I'm very rich.  The kind of rich that warps minds. Nothing offends me.  When I was eleven, I walked in on my father and the Shetland pony he had given me for my tenth birthday. Does that excite you?
FORD => I don't know, I never met your father.
FORD => Oh, that!  Don't take it personally. He always wakes up before I do. Down boy!  Roseanne Barr naked!
COLLEEN => Who's your decorator?
FORD => Some fag.  Charged me up the ass.
COLLEEN => Fag?  Ass?  I'm sorry, is that a joke?
FORD => Poor taste.  I know.  Listen, I respect homosexuals.  When I was young, my maid was a homosexual.  My maid was a homosexual.
COLLEEN => I don't have a sense of humor, either.  Sorry.
FORD => Now that we've broken the ice...
COLLEEN => I need you to find my little sister. She goes by the name Zuzu...
FORD => Zuzu Petals.  You want me to rescue her from the gorgeous hell that is L.A.
COLLEEN => But how did you know?  Here, take this picture...
FORD => No thanks.  I carry my own.
COLLEEN => Excuse me?
FORD => Let's see, you're her worried sister.  Yesterday I met her worried father who incidentally was about five years younger than you. In fact, I capped off the evening by watching him get electrocuted. They talk about cases like this in the private eye handbook... something about a ten-foot pole.
COLLEEN => Five thousand should be enough to assuage any qualms you have about my family tree.
FORD => Yeah, but of course for now, I only get a twenty.
COLLEEN => Actually, you may take it all now.
FORD => Oh... I have some questions.
COLLEEN => I have no answers.  Thanks for the stain.  Find the girl.  In the envelope are tickets to the Dorothy Chandler.  We'll chat again, then.
FORD => Ah, the Dorothy Chandler.  I was just there with my good friend Art Mooney the other night...
COLLEEN => Who?
FORD => Nuthin'.
JAZZ => K-O-D-S is going to make me rich... Uh, Ford, aren't we frisky this morning.  It's only four o'clock. I guess the early bird gets wormed...
FORD => Quiet.  Tell me you tapped in the police computer and found out lots of good stuff about Art Mooney...
JAZZ => I found a lot of Art Mooneys. None with a police record, though. Not even Synchronicity.  Have you checked out Johnny Pinzolo/Crunch's houseboat yet?
FORD => Tonight after I see Don. Some Beverly Hillbilly just hired me to find you-know-fucking-who. Name's Colleen Sutton.
JAZZ => Spooky.  I'll process her.
FORD =>  Cool.  Jazz, meet me at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion tonight. I'll have a ticket for you at the door.  Some concert.  Could be interesting.  Dress nice.
DON => I haven't seen her around, and as for who would want to kill Johnny Crunch, line forms to the left. You'd find less people on our planet who wanted him alive.
FORD =>  Great pipes.
FORD => I've heard cars fuck with more harmony.
DON => Tell me about it. Name's Kyle Troy.  Can't we bring up the bass.
MIXER => It's up as far as it can go.  Any more tricks and we're not going to be able to hear his voice at all.
DON => Don't tempt me.
FORD => How could Grendel Records sign such a wick-prick?  I guess Julian Grendel really is deaf as a fucking doorknob.  I hear Ray Charles is going to head up the video division.
GRENDEL => Actually that's rather an intriguing idea...
GRENDEL => Good to meet you, Mr. Fairlane. Your mouth makes quite a reflection.  I'm Julian Grendel.
FORD => Boing.  You're one hell of a lip reader.
GRENDEL =>  Why thank you.  It's a Christmas present.  That was my sense of humor, everyone.  I wish you would fake a laugh.  It's easy with a deaf person.
FORD => I knew your father.  He was quite...
GRENDEL => An asshole?  A swine?  A ballistic turd?  Pick one.  I never knew what a blessing my accident was until he died and I had to take over the company.  You see the music is irrelevant in this industry.  I'm going to have to ship this 'wick-prick' platinum just so teenage girls can have a compact disc cover to get wet with.
DON => Julian's happy as long as he doesn't see glass shatter.
FORD =>  I never thought I'd be jealous of your handicap... Sorry to hear about Bobby Vomit.
GRENDEL => Terrible thing, but good career move.  His record sales have gone way up.  I'll just have to create a new Black Vomit.
FORD => I was just discussing this whole Vomit thing with my friend Art Mooney.  Do you know him?
EVERYONE => Nope.
DON => What's that asshole smiling about?  That was fantastic, man.  Let's just try it one more time. (clicking off microphone) Well, sorry, Ford, I couldn't help you.  Uh, Ford.
FORD => Guys, guys, please.
KYLE => Yo, what's the hassle?
FORD => You're killing rock and raping roll.  Keith Richard's rolling in his grave and the poor bastard ain't even dead yet.  You're tearing me apart!  Rock 'n' roll is, is...
FORD => I got a '65 Cadillac.  Spare time on the back...
FORD => Charge cord to Goldblatts.  But I ain't got you.
FORD => I got women to the right of me... I got women to the left of me... I got chicks all around me... But I ain't got you.
FORD => I gotta a pocket full of crumpled bills, I gotta stomach full of different pills, I got Fanny Fox and Wilba Mills, But I ain't got you.
FORD => But I ain't got you...
BAND => But I ain't got you...
FORD => No, I ain't got you...
BAND => No, I ain't got you...
FORD => I said, I ain't got you...
BAND => I said, I ain't got you...
FORD => I ain't -- got -- you.
FORD => Now, that's entertainment.
FORD => Have a copy of that sent to me, will ya?
DON => Right away!
FORD => You guys part of a band?
PUNK GUNSLINGER =>  ... Sure.  Our name is Pain.
FORD => I wonder which boat's Johnny's?
FORD => The love boat is making another run...
JOHNNY =>  Where's my Queen Collie?  I need some order!
COLLEEN =>  Queen Collie is here.
FORD => This is why I have cable.
SMILEY => How's it going?
FORD => You're ten seconds away from the most embarrass --
FORD => Marco...
SMILEY => Polo.
FORD => Whatever you're getting paid, I can give you twenty, maybe thirty bucks more.
FORD => Had enough?
SMILEY => Feel my thumb?  I keep it there forty seconds more and a welt develops cutting off the oxygen to your brain.  I leave.  Twenty- one minutes later, you're dead. The slowest, most painful minutes a person can experience.
FORD => I guess you never saw 'A Very Brady Christmas.'
SMILEY =>  Case closed, okay?  Thirty seconds.
FORD => Fine!
SMILEY => What's fine?
FORD => I'm off it!
SMILEY => Off what?  Twenty seconds...
FORD => The case!
SMILEY => Oh.  One more thing.  This is personal.  I want you to tell me you're a big sissy.
FORD => I.  Am.  The.  Biggest.  Sissy. In.  The.  Whole.  Fucking.  World.
COLLEEN => My God, Mr. Fairlane, you look like the Fall of Saigon.
FORD => Colleen and Johnny, sitting in a tree, k-i-s-s-i-n-g...
COLLEEN => Uh, let's go sit down.
FORD =>  Excuse me...
FORD => Hey, Jazz, I told you to dress 'nice' not nice.  What, did you think this was a date?
FORD => Sorry, Jazz.  After this, I'll throw a burger down your throat, okay?
JAZZ => You're a fucking gentleman.  What do you want from me?
FORD => This Colleen Sutton woman I'm with. If she flees me to go powder her whatever, I need you to keep tabs...
COLLEEN => Ford, they're starting.
FORD => You going to be okay?
JAZZ => Go on, 'they're stahting.'
COLLEEN => So you know about Johnny Crunch and myself.
FORD =>  I'm sorry, that's gotta be a pair of tube socks he has down there.
BALLET PATRON =>  Shh.
COLLEEN => You want off the case, don't you?
FORD => Ouch... Of course I want off the case.  Some monster from Woodstock tried and succeeded in killing me tonight.  The fact I'm alive's a technicality.
COLLEEN => So you...
FORD => Listen, Queen Collie, I have a code. I never, ever, drop a case.  Besides, I, uh, used all your money to pay my bills, so I kinda owe you.
COLLEEN => Nonsense.  After what you've been through, it sounds like I owe you.
FORD =>  They did one of these about my ex- wife.  It's called 'The Nutcracker.' (after the silence; enunciating) 'The Nut-crack-er'... I don't need money.  I need some questions answered.
COLLEEN => I'll do my best.
FORD => Question one:  Can I have some money?  Kidding.  Why didn't you tell me about you and Johnny?  You two were into something even more dangerous than sex, weren't you? Who?  What?  Where?  How?  Now.
COLLEEN => Jonathan was such a beautiful man. No one knew him like I did... Excuse me.  I can't do this now. I'll call you tomorrow.
FORD => Thanks for the information. Appreciate it.
FORD => That guy gets an erection, he gives himself a black eye.  I mean, you can see him coming around a corner and still have time to comb your hair.
BALLET PATRON => Will you please be quiet.
FORD => He'll be telling that joke tomorrow.
SNOOTY NON-SMOKER => Can you read... 'smoker'?
FORD => Can you whistle 'Man in the Mirror' out your ass... 'snapperhead'?
SNOOTY NON-SMOKER => Hey, don't be a pottymouth.  I just don't want cancer.
FORD => You know, you're right, sir, and I'm sorry.  I thought I lived in a country where you were free to do any stupid thing you wanted; drive to work naked, make love to a V.C.R., but hey, you reminded me I live in a hell where any sperm like you can stab me in the heart with these things called opinions, just because you have them.
SNOOTY NON-SMOKER => It's okay.  It's okay, guy.  Smoke all you want.  Here, have one of mine...
GRENDEL => Well, hello, Ford.
FORD => Mmmmmmm.  Mmmm, mmm.
GRENDEL => I must say you're an island of reality in an ocean of diarrhea.
FORD => And it's good to see you, Julian. This is my assistant, Jazz.
JAZZ => Mmmmmmm.  Mmmm, mmm.
GRENDEL => So what did you think of the ballet? Was it like a warm Ice Capades?
FORD =>  Yeah, I did, you condescending fuck, but I miss Snoopy coming out at the end.  Isn't your enjoyment impaired?
GRENDEL => Don't worry I can run every ballet note for note in my brain...
FORD => What, were you one of those brilliant child prahdigies who was writing baroque operas while the other kids were fingerpainting Mr. Greenjeans...
GRENDEL => Something like that... Let's talk business.  I think someone is trying to rip my company off. I've tried the Yellow Pages, now I think it's your turn...
JAZZ =>  If you'll excuse us.
FORD => Jazz, we're talking here.
GRENDEL => Go on, another time, another place.
FORD => Why did you interrupt?  Maxwell seemed like he wanted to hire me.
JAZZ => Shut up, goodies from the ice queen.
FORD => How'd you get this from her?
JAZZ => You don't want to know, believe me. But don't worry, I washed my hands...
FORD => A fucking C.D.  Wow, this case is closed.  So, she's got bad taste in music and in men... Did I tell you she and Johnny were lovers and that they were into something and he got killed for it?
JAZZ =>  No, as a matter of fact you didn't. What about the girl, Zuzu Petals, how does she fit in?  I mean, she is what this case is about.
FORD => I wish I knew.  You did good work...
JAZZ => Make eye contact when you say that.
FORD => I'm sorry, that dress.  What do you say we...
JAZZ => Celebrate?  Like we celebrated after solving the White Bluesman murders?  Forget it, man.
FORD => Oh... Hey, how about that hors d'oeuvre, tonight?
FORD => Why didn't I pick fishermen?
KURT LODER =>  Police are now saying Bobby Vomit was not the victim of an overdose as first suspected, but was actually poisoned. Police have no suspects yet and have asked all Black Vomit fans not to show up at the funeral which, by the way, will be held at the Hollywood Cemetery at midnight.  In homage, here's the last video of Bobby Vomit.
SLEAZY GUY => That's one hundred.  Each.
SLEAZY GUY => Got those Vomit invites here...
FORD => Scalping to a funeral, you're a pretty sleazy guy.
SLEAZY GUY => Thanks.  You interested.  It's festival seating, so...
FORD => How much?
SLEAZY GUY => Three hundred.
FORD => You gave it to the girls for one.
SLEAZY GUY => Hey, they blew me.
FORD => Oh.  Three hundred coming right up.
FORD => Geez, am I the only one who paid full price here?
FORD => Yeah, he was one of the greats. (holding out the photo) Hey, you haven't seen this girl, have you?
FORD => Zuzu Petals!  Zuzu Petals!  Yes! Who killed Bobby Vomit?  Who killed Johnny Crunch?  Why do people want you so goddamn bad?
ZUZU => I don't know.  I'm so scared. Help me.
FORD => A simple 'please' would suffice...
ZUZU => Fluck you!
FORD => Fluck me?
FORD => K-O-D-S is going to make me rich!
SMILEY => How's it going?  Radio station contest.  Ford, I mean really...
FORD => If you hurt her, I'll kill you! Maybe not personally, but I'll think of something...
MORTICIAN ONE => Some days it's great to be alive.
MORTICIAN TWO => Hey, he took Lydia!
MORTICIAN ONE =>  So what, we've had our fun.
FORD => Now it's getting interesting, Smileyhead.
SMILEY => Normally, I'd be up for a bullshit car chase, but I got to get up early tomorrow.
SMILEY => Ford, where did you go?  Don't be such a baby...
FORD => You were saying, snapperhead?  I'll bet you're not smiling now!
SMILEY => Oh, but I am.  Dianetics, Ford.  You should try it.
FORD => Say cheese...
SMILEY => Thanks, but I have my own.
ZUZU =>  My hero...
FORD => Fuck you, man!  I can't talk... Mom!  What are you calling for? No, no, I don't always answer the phone like that.  It's business!
FORD => Have I met any nice girls?  Ma, Ma, get some sleep.  I gotta another call... (pressing call waiting) Sorry, it was my mom...
SMILEY => Your mom is special.  I look forward to raping her at your funeral.
FORD => You are one sick...
FORD => Damn baby, I hope you filled out some organ donor cards...
FORD => Zuzu Petals, I'm Ford Fairlane! I'm the good guy, he's the bad guy!
ZUZU => This is so amazing!  A car chase! Let's get on some car chase music! Ra-a-w-wk!
ZUZU => It's red, Ford.
FORD => What?
ZUZU => Hello?
FORD => Give me your gum and grab the wheel.
FORD => You okay?
ZUZU =>  Peachy.
VOLUPTUOUS WOMAN => Boy, you morticians really know how to party...
ZUZU => Nyah, nyah, nyah-nyah, nyah.
ZUZU => That was one of the ten most provocative experiences of my life!
FORD => Let's get serious...
ZUZU => Why are all these people after me?
FORD => Uh... wha?  You're supposed to answer those questions, not ask 'em.  I take it a woman named Colleen Sutton is not your big sister and that the late D.J. Johnny Crunch ain't your daddy?
ZUZU => I'm so sure!  I'm an only child and my parents are Bill and Shirley Petals of South Bend, Indiana. They run a hardware store and...
FORD => You hung out with Bobby Vomit. Who would want him dead?
ZUZU =>  I dunno.  He was to sound what Cezanne was to image or at least I thought so.  Ever since he died, I've been chased... Omigod!
FORD => What?  Jesus, tell me!
ZUZU => It's Spunk Lewis, the lead singer for Dead Ribbit!  Mr. Bus Driver, stop!
ZUZU => Spunk, come back...
FORD => How is it you can look at that HairHead and see God, when all I see is a lucky asshole from Reseda.
ZUZU => Because I know rock-n-roll.
FORD => You know rock-n-roll?  Darlin', I've been in the music industry for as long as you've lived.  I've seen things you can't even have nightmares about... but then I guess I'm just not equipped to know the industry the way you do...
ZUZU => Come again?  B.FL.D., I have sex with rock stars; it's not like I'm doing something that I don't enjoy with them, like shuffleboard. Don't worry about me, I practice safe sex and next summer, I'm going to U.C.L.A.
FORD => Zuzu Petals, you're not bad.  In fact, I was discussing this whole rock-n-roll thing with my pal Art Mooney the other day.  You know him?
ZUZU => No.  Who's Art Mooney?
FORD => He's the lamest clue I've ever had in my life.  Here's our stop...
JAZZ => Why don't I despise you?
FORD => What did you... Hey, where's your spex?
JAZZ => Contacts.
FORD => I like.
ZUZU => He saved my life!  Isn't he the coolest man in the world?
JAZZ => Says a lot about the world... Zuzu Petals... Case closed?
FORD => I don't know, what was the case?
JAZZ => Ms. Sutton hired you to find the girl.  Period.
FORD => Then I guess her case is closed. Mine isn't.  I want to know why everybody wants Zuzu.  Why people are killing and dying for her.
ZUZU => Yeah, it's weird.  Bobby and Johnny were such good friends...
FORD => Friends?  You didn't tell me that.
ZUZU => You didn't ask.  Have you ever thought about mousse?
ZUZU => K-O-D-S is going to make me rich... Uh...
JAZZ => She's just a bundle of energy, a real treasure...
FORD => Yeah, let's bury her.
JAZZ => Hello...  It's Colleen.  With answers.  She wants to meet.  Down.  Way down-town.  Late.
COLLEEN => I ask you to find a girl and instead you steal a C.D. from me. Ford.  You suck.
FORD => I'll buy you a new one.  I found her.
COLLEEN => Zuzu Petals!  Did she have it?
FORD => Have what?
COLLEEN => Did she tell you anything?
FORD => Lots of things.  Her favorite yogurt.  The ten drummers she would take to a desert island...
COLLEEN => Drink your cappucino, you're giving me a headache...
COLLEEN => If feels like it's going to explode.
COLLEEN => Damnit... you were right last night. Jonathan and I were into more than sex.  Along with Bobby Vomit, right after old Jack Grendel died, we took part in a scheme to rip off Grendel records... I didn't want you involved...
FORD => But I am...
FORD => What cheap shit... hey, waiter!
COLLEEN => We invested in these factories. In Vancouver.
FORD => Hold that thought.  Are we being shot at?
FORD => I finally got you to laugh.
COLLEEN => That was close...
FORD => What did these Vancouver factories do?
COLLEEN => I haven't told you the important part!
COLLEEN => Art Mo-o-o-ney!
FORD => Thanks, I needed that.
SMILEY => You assholes owe me a Big Gulp.
LT. AMOS => Have a problem, call Ford Fairlane.  He won't solve your case, but who cares, you'll be dead in a couple days anyway. Let's face it.  After today, the California Raisins aren't gonna hire you.
FORD => That's okay.  I'm quitting the music detective business to become a cop killer.  Pay's the same, but it'll be much more fun.
LT. AMOS => God, I wish I could prove you killed everybody.  Unfortunately, I know who the real killer is.
FORD => Really?
LT. AMOS => It's some psycho killer groupie. I got an anonymous letter that says she killed Bobby Vomit, Johnny Crunch, and now, this society dame.
FORD => Once I got an anonymous letter saying that the world would be destroyed by a giant purple raindrop. I didn't even buy a fucking umbrella... You were in too many discos during the seventies.  The Village People rotted your brain.
LT. AMOS => That's the difference between a great investigator like me and a piece of Spam like you.  You look at this picture and all you see is beauty.  I see the beast.
ZUZU => Yeah, on a car phone!  No, he's not a guitarist... he's better... He's a rock-n-roll detec --
JAZZ => You okay?
FORD => Lieutenant Anus has discovered the cold-blooded killer behind everything.
JAZZ => Who?
JAZZ => Ah, an obvious choice.
FORD => Let's get her out of here, before she starts a shoot-out.  Drop us at my place.
ZUZU => Why are you depressed?  You get in all the clubs, you never pay cover...
FORD => Stop.  We still got serious detective stuff to do, but we've been up all night so we should hit the sack for...
ZUZU =>  What a perv...
ZUZU => Let's watch some 'M.T.V.'
FORD => People still watch that?
ZUZU => Who cares about people?
FORD => Zuzu!
FORD => Zuzu, wake up...
ZUZU => Hah fluck, great video, huh?
FORD => Are you okay?
ZUZU => Okay?  I just blew up.  I feel orgasmic.
FORD => Puh-leeze...
FORD => My axe!
ZUZU => Ford, do you got something cooking in the microwave?
FORD => Out!
ZUZU => Wait, my purse!
FORD => Wait, my purse?
ZUZU => Maybe it was just a pot pie.
THE KID => I tried to stop them, man.
THE KID => I'm sorry...
FORD => Shut up, you dummy.  Who did this to you?
THE KID => These two guys in long cowboy coats and real nice suits.  I think Armani.  They were going through your stuff with screwdrivers and shit... I did what you would have done.
FORD => Run to the nearest phone and call the police.
THE KID => Fuck that, I mean, the heck with that.  I kicked their ass!  Well, I tried.  There were two of them you know...
FORD => Jesus, how could you be so stupid?  Come on, we're going to a hospital.
THE KID => I tried to help you...!
FORD => And hey, I appreciate it...
THE KID =>  Where's my father?  Have you even looked?
FORD => Yeah, uh, I got some pretty good leads...
THE KID => Liar!  You don't care!  About anything.
FORD => Well, at least the guys at the garage brought my baby back.
FORD => Why the music industry?  Ford Fairlane, detective of the fishermen.
FORD => Ah!  Mo-ther-fu --
MELODI => Hi, private eye guy!
FORD => Hey, the poet...
MELODI => Oh wow, hiding out from cold blooded killers.  The sisters are going to die...
MELODI => Hey, troops, here's that rock 'n' roll detective I told you about.
FORD =>  Hebedeebuh.  Hebedeebuh.  Maybe I did die in the explosion.
ZUZU => I know the feeling.  This must be hell.  Can you believe, a flucking sorority... I'm gonna vomit Day-Glo.
FORD => Ye-ah.  Sure.
ZUZU => Don't forget, Jazz, bonewad.
JAZZ => Hello, Ford...
FORD => What are you doing at the office? You wouldn't believe what I've gone through tonight... I'm calling from the Mega Beta Pogo Sorority.
FORD => Mmmh!  My house was blown up, my car was blown up, and my koala bear isn't in too great a shape, either.  'That's too bad.'  All you can say is 'That's too bad.'
JAZZ => Yes, Ford, that's all I can say.
FORD => So, then Springsteen says to Madonna, 'Hey, I only eat lime Jell-O...'
MELODI => Sisters, sisters, give Ford a break.  What do you say we induct him as an honorary member...
SISTERS => Yeah!
PUNK GUNSLINGER =>  It's a tough business...
SISTERS => Quantas -- Jujubees -- Salcido -- Ford Fairlane -- Quantas -- Jujubees...
FORD => Everybody, blow!
PUNK GUNSLINGER => It's cut-our-losses time, dude.
FORD => All work and no play makes Ford a dull boy.
MELODI => Sisters, don't get your robes wet.
JAZZ => Why do we have to have an office on the second floor?
JAZZ => I came to warn you...
FORD => Oh, Jazz, those bastards... call an ambulance!  Get that music off!
ZUZU => Sure, I have a much more appropriate C.D.  Bobby sneaked it into my purse the day he died.  It was so romantic...
MELODI => This isn't music!
FORD => It is to us!  It's computerised.
JAZZ => I believe the last time we came across one of these, was at the ballet.  What were your words... (in Ford's gruff, facetious tone) 'A fucking C.D.  This case is closed.'
FORD =>  I've always said the one reason I'm the best detective in the industry is that I'm the only one... but hey, I never throw away a clue...
FORD => Sisters, the sorority computer...
FORD => Aha, just what I suspected!
JAZZ => You're not funny.
ZUZU => This is boring, guys.
FORD => Zuzu, be quiet.  Put in Colleen's disc.  Number two.
ALL GIRLS => Bor-ring.
FORD => Hey!
JAZZ => Hmmm, the first disc was putting out an incomprehensible stream of high bits.  This one is putting out low bits.  The data is in some fucked binary system.  The two discs need to interface simultaneously with a third decryptor disc.  Comprendo?
FORD => Su-ure.  Two people hired me to find Zuzu in order to get hold of one of those discs and Colleen threw a tizz when we took hers.  Obviously, all this binary disc shit is pretty mighty.  But it's not necessary.  People are dead.  One was a friend.  The same people were involved in a scam to rip off Grendel Records. Bottom line's Julian Grendel is doing a little revenge number...
FORD => Jazz, get to a hospital.  Zuzu and I are going to feel things out with Mr. Grendel.  If I don't call in an hour... hell, I don't know.
FORD => Uh, nice piano.  Probably get a lot of complaints from the neighbors -- heh...  It's another time, Julian, another place.  If I told you Bobby Vomit, Johnny Crunch, and Colleen Sutton were the ones you were complaining about, the ones who tried to rip you off, what would your reaction be?
GRENDEL =>  Shock.
FORD => And if I told you that you already knew all that shit, and that you had them killed, what would you do then?
GRENDEL => Golly, I'd probably faint.
ZUZU => Uh-oh.
SMILEY => Bro, they still can't get that spot out.
ZUZU => Ford, you were right!
FORD => Ye-ah.
GRENDEL => Actually you're a bit off in the motivation department... I mean, revenge is so... Bronson. (furious, coming to the third modem) Wait, where's the third C.D.?  How could you come here without proof? It's a three piece set here!  A computer disc from Colleen, Bobby's computer disc, and Johnny's computer disc.  Together they make, oh fucking forget it!
FORD => Yeah, yeah, I know the third one unscrambles the high bits and the low bits.  Shit, just start torturing me, man.  I didn't even know Johnny had a disc and I can't deal with any 'Don't play games with me, Mr. Fairlane' bullshit.
GRENDEL => Don't play games... ugh.  Did you say you don't have the third... ugh. (a beat of contemplation) I'm not going to torture you, Ford.
GRENDEL => Not her, Ford.  I'm afraid sometimes a pussy is just a pussy, but a 1962 Fender Stratocaster with an original Humbucking Pick-ups, maple neck, strung upside down for a left-handed genius -- Jimi Hendrix, is something else entirely.
FORD => No!  U-gh!
PUNK GUNSLINGER => Hey, that's the sound your koala bear made when we hung it.
GRENDEL => It doesn't have to be like this?
FORD => Oh God, please, don't!
GRENDEL => Don't you think this guitar would look a lot neater with Ford's name on it?
GUNSLINGERS => Ooooooh, yeah.
FORD => Rape!
FORD => Okay!  Okay.  You got me.  Boy, you guys are tough.  I have the third disc.  Indeed.  I.  Do. Yes, sir. (smiling, a light bulb dimly lighting) Yeah you assholes, it's in a very safe place with instructions to have it sent directly to the police if I don't make a phone call by seven o'clock.  So if you'll excuse us...
GRENDEL => It's 7:30.  You really should get a watch.
FORD => Ah, I didn't say seven P.M., now did I?
GRENDEL => Ford.  Ford.  Ford.  It's too bad it had to end like this.  We could have been friends.  We're so much alike.  We both know 'Rock-N-Roll' is all bullshit.  That life is a disease and everyone's a victim. Hell, we even smoke the same brand of cigarettes.
FORD => I just gave up smoking.  A last drink?
GRENDEL => I'm running a little late.  You see, I'm having a party at THE Club to introduce the new lead singer for Black Vomit.  Everyone in the industry will be there, including our friend, Don Cleveland.
FORD => What about Don?
GRENDEL => Before Black Vomit starts its set, Don will have his head blown off. The papers next week will reveal that he was partners with Bobby, Johnny, and Collie in 'the Grendel Records scam.'  He killed them to pay off a debt to 'the mob' or something lame like that.  And then the mob iced him.  It's all more tasteful than it sounds.
ZUZU => I can't believe you guys hung a koala bear...
ZUZU => That is.  So.  Graphic.  I mean I'm still in shock here.  You know I had a dream about a priest hanging a koala bear during my first communion...
GRENDEL =>  Is she saying what I think she's...
FORD => I'm afraid so, you want her?
ZUZU => But you know, that was just a dream.  Doesn't really count.
FORD =>  Julian, you're evil incarnate. And you know, while I'm a little angry that you're going to kill me and all, I gotta salute your toughness.  Life threw you lemons, and gall darnit, you made lemonade. Julian Grendel, guys like you don't grow on trees.  Here's to you... (smashing the glass into Julian's head) sucking my dick.
SMILEY => Take a free hit, bro.  Come on...
GRENDEL => Sure...
GRENDEL => Kill them.  Not quickly.
FORD => Are you okay?
ZUZU => If you ask me that question one more...
FORD => When I say 'no,' run for the door.
GRENDEL =>  Oh, wait.  One sec.  Open the window.
FORD => Shit.
GRENDEL => Ciao.
FORD => Don't hurt me?
FORD => Now!
FORD => Move it!
ZUZU => Nice left you got there, jerk.
FORD => Sorry, it was dark, now come on.
ZUZU => This way...
FORD => No, wait...
ZUZU => Suck a dick, I left my purse...
FORD => As Clark Gable said to Ava Gardner in Mogambo:  'Fuck the purse, we're gonna die-e-e.'
ZUZU => Reality-reality-reality -- Outrageous building, huh?
FORD => Ye-ah.
FORD => And you say I never take you anywhere.
SMILEY => Let's rock.
FORD => Pretty smooth, huh?
ZUZU => Smooth.  I know this is dangerous and everything but it's kind of fun. Ever see "Batman," you know when Batman and Robin are climbing up the side of the building and somebody sticks their head outside the window and says... I forget what they said but it's pretty funny.
FORD => Why have you come to my planet?
FORD => Around!
FORD/ZUZU => Wow.
ZUZU => Oops.
TOUR GUIDE => The building is a symbol for the music industry, a business where anything can happen and usually...
TOUR GUIDE => ... does.
ZUZU => Ick.
FORD => I won't ask why you would want to help someone trying to kill you, but hey, good job.  Shall we?
SMILEY => How's it going?
ZUZU => Oh, Fo-ord!
ZUZU => Fluck this.
FORD => I want you to say that you're the biggest sissy in the whole wide world.
SMILEY => I'm.  The.  Biggest.  Sissy.  In. The.  Wide.  World.
FORD => Okay.  'B-y-e!
FORD => Hey.  God.  You're an asshole.
ZUZU => Let go of the belt!  What are you doing?  You got mad at me for trying to save the other guy.
FORD => I can't kill this kid's father...
ZUZU => Who do you think you are, Ford? The tooth fairy.  Kill!  Kill!  Kill!
FORD => This is fucking unbelievable.  Zuzu, it's a long story, you see...
FORD => 'Excuse me, while I kiss the sky.' (loudly hums a 'Haze' riff) Whoooo!  Oh, God, buddy, I'm sorry for calling you an asshole. You're number one, man!  Hey, Zuzu, look I found my guitar.
FORD => You're tearing me apart, here!
FORD => Sorry, Jimi.
ZUZU => Thanks.  I know how much that thang meant to you.
ZUZU => Hello, Mr. Tongue!  What a perv.
FORD =>  You wish.  Come on, let's get outta here.
FORD => Go back to Michigan, asswipe.
FORD => What's the fucking difference?
FORD => Are you okay?
ZUZU =>  There's that question...
JAZZ => How'd it go?
FORD => Your timing swallows the massive one. Grendel just tried to kill us, he's about to frame and kiss Don, and we can't do shit.  Don't even ask about those discs. Goddamn that Art Mooney with a star by his name!  It's tied to Johnny's C.D., I know.
JAZZ => Johnny's C.D.?
ZUZU => Maybe Art Mooney's the name of like a constellation...
JAZZ => And maybe the stars correlate with a map in the Thomas Guide... sounds pretty decaf, doesn't it?
FORD => Ladies, life's not that complicated.
FORD => Art, baby!
ZUZU => Oh how sweet, your friend's got his own star.
FORD => ArtArtArtArtMooneyMooneyMooney Mooney.
JAIME => This is the best party ever thrown here...
GRENDEL => It's going to be a night to remember...
FORD => What an interface!
JAZZ => Seems to be information about a factory in Vancouver.
FORD => Yeah, Colleen mentioned it.  What do they make?
JAZZ => C.D.s.  The music kind.  From the Grendel label.
FORD => Without Grendel knowing about it. B-I-N-G-O and Bingo was his name-O. Counterfeit C.D.s.  Tape piracy has graduated to disc piracy, the sound quality's better, and so's the money.
JAZZ => But the funny thing is, take a look at these Swiss bank account numbers. We got Bobby, Johnny, Colleen... and Julian Grendel.
DON => I wish you could hear the buzz this party is making...
GRENDEL => I can feel it, man... Can I talk to you in private...
ZUZU => Grendel was in charge of the ripping off of the company.
JAZZ => It started after Old Jack Grendel died, the others were just investors.
FORD => After their initial investment in the factory, Grendel didn't need them.  Told them to fuck off. They tried to get these C.D.s together in order to have proof of Grendel's involvement, so they could keep him in line.  Now's the fun part...
JAZZ => I can't believe I lost an eye for a bunch of phony C.D.s
ZUZU => Oh God, the door's locked.  We're going to have to crawl down!
ZUZU =>  Psyche.
GRENDEL => What can I say, Don, it's business.  Dump the body in, let's say, Chinatown.
FORD => Hey, Don, how's the high blood pressure.
DON => Could somebody tell me what's going on?  Like slo-owly...
ZUZU => You-see-it-all-starts-with-this- factory-in-Vancouver-and there's these-C.D.s...
FORD => I'll mail you a letter, come on!
JAZZ => Let's see, you threw me through a plate glass window and I hit you with my Volkswagen.  I think we're in for a fair fight.
JAZZ => Maybe not...
GRENDEL => They make jokes about the music industry.  They say it's cutthroat, they say it's cynical, well we know the truth!  There's a lot of love in this room tonight, but, but...
GRENDEL => But I've talked long enough.  Now, the moment you've been waiting for. I'd like you to meet the new singer for Black Vomit... Kyle Troy!
FORD => Read.  My.  Lips.  You're.  Going. Down.
SAM => I used to be just like you, abusing women to hide my emotional insecurities.  I realize now that a little insecurity is good for a man.
JAZZ => Sam the Sleazebag to the rescue!
SAM => You're ten seconds away from the most embarrassing moment of your life.
JAZZ => Please say you won't move!  I don't want to shoot you, actually I wouldn't mind, but please, say you won't move.
PUNK GUNSLINGER =>  Die, whore!
JAZZ => I guess that's a no...
JAZZ => Come on, Sam, vodka milkshakes are on me.
FORD => You'd said something about proof...
GRENDEL => Oh please, Ford, I'll do any --
FORD => And may I suggest for dessert, the five copies I made...
GRENDEL => Fuck me...
FORD => Maybe later, but first I want like to know why you'd steal from your own company...
GRENDEL => When I was young, I read Billboard and I could not believe how much Grendel Records and how little of it my idiot father Old Jack Grendel got.
FORD => Yeah, it's pretty amazing how much cash you gotta give to the actual artists who create the music.  Those ingrates really take a bite.  But seriously, when Pops died, you got Vomit, Crunch, and Sutton to help finance a C.D. Cleans operation. You got greedy and they tried to get the three discs together to threaten you, but...
GRENDEL => What is this, are you holding a microphone behind my head?
GRENDEL => I should kill more music people! When I was sixteen, I wrote an opera, the greatest piece of music ever created in the 20th Century outside the Dirty Dancing soundtrack.  It was called 'Paco the Shoeshine Boy.'  When I showed it to my father, he said it 'wasn't happening.'  That 'no playlists worth his while would touch it'!
GRENDEL => Let's face it, making money is the only art form open to innovation. Whoever says they're in the business because they like music is a lying pathetic piece of shit or total idiot like Kyle Troy...
ZUZU => Is this guy flucked up or what? I think he's going to blow!
GRENDEL => The day my father turned down 'Paco' I dedicated my life to taking over this fucking industry and making it so disgusting, so sleazy, and so corrupt that it would have to self-destruct!  I even pissed in the punchbowl tonight...
FORD => Man, Julian, that accident took away more than your hearing.
GRENDEL => Accident?  Accident!  You naive pussball, when I realized my life of music could only be a life of music industry.  I cut my fucking ears off so I'd only hear my music. Here, look.
ZUZU => Hoh graphic!  I'm going to dream of ears for a year!  Ugh!
FORD => Just be thankful he wasn't dissatisfied with his sex life.
GRENDEL => You little bitch...
ZUZU =>  'Feelings, whoa oh, feelings...'
SAM => Jazz!
JAZZ => Ford!
GRENDEL => I'm still the king!
FORD =>  Julian, you're fired.
JAIME => Is this for real, Larry?
LARRY => No way, Jaime.  He's wearing this gooey stuff on his body that the flames can't affect.  Bobby Vomit opened his act this way.
LARRY => Now that... I have no idea...
DON => Thanks for the promotion, man.
FORD => No prob...
ZUZU => Look who I found.  It's Damion Flemm!  He's taking me on tour to Japan!
FORD => So, Zuzu.  Are you okay?
ZUZU => Yeah, Ford.  I'm okay.
LT. AMOS => You do realize that tonight is disco appreciation night at the Coconut Teazer...
DETECTIVE => I'm sorry, sir, but we got a report that Fairlane and the psycho- killer-groupie are here.
LT. AMOS => There they are!  Hey!
LT. AMOS => I should've known you two were in this together...
LT. AMOS => Sorry, sexual favors won't help...
FORD => Happy listening...
SAM => I've learned my lesson, Ford. Thanks.
OVARY TWO => Isn't he the best?  Why don't you come out with us?
FORD => Can't.  Have you seen my assistant, Jazz?
OVARY ONE => She took off.  Said something about you being a real asshole.
SMILEY => How's it going?
FORD => You gotta be kidding!  This is unfuckingbelievable!  I have to start the evening crawling down Capital Records, I shoulda chose suicide then, but oh no, the night was young!  Next up, my guitar! The second most important thing I own and now it's toothpicks for the homeless on Hollywood Boulevard!  Then, then, after I burned up your brother, Jazz... I should say as a fucking footnote I've usually treated women like shit -- used corsages, the wet spot, you know giving out Domino's Pizza's phone number and saying it's mine... Tonight was different. I felt respect.  I felt love.  Then Jazz left me... and now I get to die!
SMILEY => The point?
