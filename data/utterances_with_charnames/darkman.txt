BANG!! => A shock chord as we cut from black to a harshly toplit
CLOSE SHOT => A man is talking into a cellular phone. He is a paunchy but powerful looking black man, bald with a gray fringe. His baldness makes his head look muscular; he is a tough man whose life has been shaped by the violence of the docks. His name is EDDIE BLACK. In the distance a foghorn moans. We are pulling back.
BLACK => Yeah. .'Cause he's an asshole. Tell him no... Tell him no too... Him, tell fuck you... Yeah... Uh huh... The continuing pull back shows that we are inside a huge empty pier building. Black is leaning against the roof of his car, which is parked in the middle of the vast empty space. The room is lit by bare bulbs, its farthest reaches falling into darkness.
BLACK => No, I'll be a few minutes here. Guy comin' up, thinks he's gonna muscle me outs my property... Does it matter? Just another tough guy...Yeah, okay... Another hard-looking man is approaching.
MAN => They're drivin' up. Black nods.
BLACK => Get their pieces. We got a surprise for those fuckers.
Continentals. => The cars stop in the foreground and eight men get out, eerily backlit in the mist of the riverfront.
DOCK WORKER => Okay, against the car, ladies. You're c gonna stand for a search. 12 The eight visitors assume the position, placing their 12 hands on the roof of their car. The dock workers pat them down and haul off iron -- lots of it.
14 BLACK => stands waiting for them. He eyes Skip, the limper.
BLACK => Bum leg?
SKIP => No leg.
BLACK => I hadda break it off.
BLACK => okay, let's cut the crap here. Durant, I got just three things to say to you. One He holds up a chubby finger.
BLACK => I ain't selling my property. He flashes a second finger.
BLACK => Two. Nobody muscles Eddie Black Especially a bunch of fucks. He flashes a third finger.
PPY => Number three, if you guys is unha with that, which I can already is, then we can cutcha balls of f if that'll be more satisfactory.
19 CONTINUED => The last shot echoes away to leave silence -- except for the arhythmic echoing scuffle of Skip's one shoe, as he continues to hop in place for balance. Smiley, after a watchful pause to make sure everyone is dead, sticks out his left arm at waist level. Skip grabs the arm for support, stops hopping, and there is now...total silence.
DURANT => Now let's consider my points, one by one...
GUZMAN => puts a full nelson on Black. Trumayne, grabs Black's right hand and holds it out, fingers splayed, towards Durant.
DURANT => One... He slips one of Black's fingers into his cigar trimmer.
DURANT => .1 try not to let my anger get the better of me. SNIP! Black screams. As Durant goes for another finger:
DURANT => ...Two: I don't always succeed. SNIP! Black screams. Reaching for another finger:
DURANT => ...Three: I've got seven more points.
EYE => Blinking.
NOSE => The nostrils flare slightly.
EYE => Looking.
NOSE => Still. Suddenly it is hit by a flash of light as -- B- DEEEE -- we hear the automatic wind of a camera and its strobe recharging. B-DEEEEE! B-DEEEE! We get rapid-fire left and right nose profiles.
22 WIDER => We are in a lab. DR. PEYTON WESTLAKE, an earnest scientist in his early thirties, is straightening up from behind a futuristic looking, tripod-mounted camera. He front the camera and instantly hits a button nt of ut. thenfro eof o
PEYTON => Now, if everything goes according to plan, in a couple of months your nose will be on the lips of every American... He is feeding the prints into the input slot of a computer.
PEYTON => We've finally got the Imager working how we want it. 24 We pan to the Holographic Imaging Cylinder. The glass 24 cylinder, wired to the computer, glows to life. 24P A three dimensional holographic image of Yakatito's nose 24P rotates within. 25 Peyton glances from the Imager to the computer. He types 25 on the computer keyboard.
PEYTON => Bio-press checks out okay... He glances to...
PEYTON => I don't know about perfect, but it looks like your nose. Down to the millimole... No, the bio-press won't be a problem. It's the synthetic
WOULD => skin's instability. If the
A SKINU => just hold up -- Y give me victim and a photograph of his old face -- he'll get more than a nose. We're talking complete reconstruction
MAYBE EVEN => damaged skin tissue. make him better looking. Hey, what's the time?
YAKITITO => fumbles for the stopwatch that hangs around his neck.
YAKITITO => Ninety-eight minute and change.
PEYTON => Let's check in our friends.
PEYTON => moves to a microscope.
EPIDERMIS => On the right half of the screen, another image forms. It is a second molecule. Beneath it, the words:
STRUCTURAL MATCH => The molecules rotate in synchronization. A loud beeping tone. Suddenly, the synthetic molecule begins to waver and spin randomly.
30 PEYTON => Oh no...
PEYTON => Fragmentation. Time? Yakitito checks his stopwatch.
YAKITITO => Ninety-nine minute. Again.
32 CONTINUED => He stares dumbly at the stopwatch, frozen. He repeats,
YAKITITO => ..Ninety-nine minute. Cells always break up at a ninety-nine minute. He punches away at a keyboard and takes the readout.
PEYTON => Electrolytes, temp and glucose concentration. all normal.
YAKITITO => But still this ninety nine minute. Yakitito makes a notation of the time on a lab sheet.
PEYTON => Pacing, thinking;
PEYTON => Why? What is destabilizing it? Vivification process was cake. Tissue rejection? We licked that. We're close. We're smart guys. So why can't we make these cells stable? Hokay. Let's try a ten percent alkalinity. Get those suckers too drunk to fragment.
YAKITITO => posts the completed lab sheet on a wall covered with hundreds of similar sheets.
YAKITITO => We already try ten. He pokes at a section of lab sheets.
YAKITITO => And twenty. And twenty-two... We try all phase of alkalinity. He punches the wall. CONTINUED
YAKITITO => But still a ninety-nine minute! Three month ago, ninety nine minute. Ten month ago... ninety nine minute... BAM BAM... Yakitito punches the wall again and again. Peyton calmly taps a plastic dunking bird that slowly bobs.
PEYTON => A word of advice, Yakitito. Don't get emotionally involved. Watch. Analyze. Remain object ---
BAM! => He is cut off as Yakitito punches the wall again and again to punctuate his speech.
YAKITITO => Maybe I am lousy scientist.
MAYBEOI => listen to father, get in Anaheim! Get drunk on Sake nightly, forget I am failure!
PEYTON => Quick, Yakitito. A basketball appears in Peyton's hands. He tosses it to
YAKITITO => Catches the ball.
PEYTON => The most striking characteristic of thermionic emission.
YAKITITO => Throws the ball away.
KE => No, always you ask me question to ma me calm down! I no want to calm down!
PEYTON => catches the ball, dribbles and throws it back to Yakitito.
PEYTON => The answer, Yakitito.
YAXITITO => snags the ball angrily from the air.
PEYTON => Go on! Again he pump-fakes. Yakitito flinches.
YAKITITO => This means the temperature of the emitter is not critical as long as it is sufficiently high and as long as pure metals with high operating temperatures such as tungsten or tantalum are used. Peyton tosses him the ball. Yakitito catches it. Calm now. He blinks.
YAKITITO => Amazing. It work every time.
33 CONTINUED => JULIE HASTINGS, a young attractive woman who has apparently been awaiting their arrival rises from a chair and crosses the lobby to greet them. She is dressed in a conservative business suit and carries a briefcase.
JULIE => Mr. Strack, my name is Julie Hastings. I'm here from Pappas and Swain to represent you in the Von Hoffenstein negotiation.
STRACK JR. => How do you do? And please, call me Louis. This is my father who-- Strack Sr. interrupts his son's introduction.
STRACK SR. => I don't want some fancy-ass woman to do my negotiating. Where's Herb Gorson?
JULIE => Gorson's tied up in litigation this week. Don't worry--I've done my homework.
STRACK SR. => scowls, ungraciously accepting her.
STRACK SR. => .If he goes that low, lock him up.
Myron Katz. => Liveried waiters are just clearing the table and serving coffee.
KATZ => We want to be reasonable here. We said we were interested in selling the pier frontage and we are interested in selling. But frankly Mr. Von .will not be robbed. Seventy-five strikes us as a fair price for this parcel. We're ready to conclude a deal here and now at that price.
JULIE => Then I guess we're only missing one element here.
KATZ => What's that?
JULIE => An interested party. Strack Jr. tries to suppress a smile. Waiters bring in the wine and pour a tasting portion for Von Hoffenstein, silent, coldly watchful. He rolls the wine in his glass, eyes appraising Julie. He takes a sip, cocks his head, nods. Wine is poured around.
JULIE => .Mr. Katz, I've found that in the real estate business, three factors determine a property's worth. CONTINUED
34 CONTINUED => Katz leans forward, listening.
JULIE => ...Location. Location. And... location. Frankly, you have none of the above. Your fair price is fair for midtown commercial, not for riverfront.
KATZ => It's worth more to your client, given his plans for the area.
JULIE => if my client can spin straw into gold, he'll still pay market price for straw. As a matter of fact--
VON HOFFENSTEEN => --Business is business. Deals vill come and go, but ze velt vill pause for a beautiful voman...and a fine wine.
JULIE => Our offer stands at forty-eight.
VON HOFFENSTIEN => Smiles a worldly smile.
VON HOFFINSTIEN => Let us toast a zale at ze price of zixty millions. Strack Sr. smiles. He starts to raise his glass, preparing to toast.
JULIE => To Von Hoffenstein: CONTINUED
JULIE => You're moving in the right direction, but our offer stands firm. i believe if anyone had
BE => offered you more than us, you'd sharing this wine with them. She sips the wine and then, frowning, turns to the wine steward.
JULIE => .There's been a mistake. We ordered a bottle of '67 Beaujolais Maison Reme. Is that not correct?
STEWARD => Oui madame. '67 Beaujolais Maison Reme. Is what I have serve. Julie pleasantly but firmly corrects him.
JULIE => No. You have served us a 1981 or 1982. California Beaujolais.
YOU'RE => Pleasant, but hardly worth charging... Strack Sr., frowning, examines the wine. It's news to him.
STEWARD => Please, Madame! I serve the Reme!
STRACK SR. => Mine tastes okay.
KATZ => Ms. Hastings, please. The wine is fine. You're way out of your league here. I'm sure the wine steward--
FROM => plucks the CALIFORNIA
34 CONTINUED => The wine steward whispers sharply in French to the waiter, then turns back to the table.
STEWARD => Please forgive us. We bring the bel Reme.at once. Gratis. Julie addresses the baron.
JULIE => At any rate, our offer stands at forty-eight... As she rises:
JULIE => .And if we can't toast, we prefer not to drink. These gentlemen and I have other business to attend to, so if you'll excuse us... Strack Sr. rises, angrily. He turns to leave with her, murmuring under his breath:
STRACK SR. => I told you to make this deal. Von Hoffenstein calls after them his wine glass held
VON HOFFENSTEIN => Permit me, madame! Too fine a vine not to use for a toast!
STRACK JR. => How much did she pay you?
STRACK JR. => For that little trick with the labels. He takes the stewards fist in his and unfurls the steward's fingers. Revealing--A HUNDRED DOLLAR BILL. Strack Jr. turns to Julie's retreating figure and smiles.
WHOOOSH! => The fluid disappears from the bottom beaker and instantly reconstitutes in the top beaker as a steaming brown fluid.
lips. => He looks down into his microscope.
PEYTON => .Time, Yakitito.
YAKITITO => Ninety eight minute. A light goes out, leaving the lab in darkness except for the glow from the computer screen.
YAKITITO => .Is a bulb. I get a fresh.
37 CONTINUED => As he rummages in a drawer:
YAKITITO => So, did you ask her?
PEYTON => Tonight. Out of habit, Peyton glances back to the microscope.
YAKITITO => This is unbelievable! You been saying tonight for weeks and still you don't ask her! Maybe I ask to marry you.
PEYTON => Your father would never approve of me. Yakitito stares at him in puzzlement. Then:
YAKITITO => 216, no, I ask he if gbg marry you. I Peyton looks through the microscope;
PEYTON => Time, Yakitito!
YAKITITO => Huh?! One hundred minute! Peyton grips at the table with excitement.
PEYTON => The cells are holding, Yakitito.
YAKITITO => Dr. Westlake punch the wall! Dr. Westlake punch the wall!
YAKITITO => You Punch You answer the quesiton. flinches, to c ch t winds back to toss u B e i ball pump -faked to cat ch t he ball. t ever comes-- Yakitito
STRACK JR. => Gold Kugerands are looking attractive. Another long pause.
STRACK SR. => Are those the ones with the chocolate centers? Another pause.
STRACK SR. => Krugerrands. Sounds like a frog trying to burp. Strack Industries will stick with real estate. You remember that.
STRACK SR. => What the hell!
DRIVER => We have a flat, sir. I'm sorry.
STRACK SR. => You should be. This'll come out of your wages.
THE TIRE => is'NOT flat.
THE DRIVER => discretely removes a straight-razor from his coat pocket and approaches the tire.
STRACK SR. => Time I took a leak anyway. Damn prostate. There's only one thing I gotta do myself and I gotta do it twenty times a day. Strack Sr. exits the car.
THE TIRE => is now deflated.
STRACK SR. => ments room. CAMERA MOVES

THE MAN => Closer now. A one-quarter-view of the man's downturned face. he looks up--revealing DURANT! A terrible malevolent grin as he lifts his newspaper. We make out the muzzle of a silencer. CAMERA SWISHES TO.
HIGH ANGLE => The two men pass.
STRACK JR. => Father?
STRACK JR. => races out of the car and rushes over to his father.
STRACK JR. => Father!
STRACK SR. => lies motionless on his stomach. Strack Jr. turns him over, revealing that Strack Sr.'s chest is flooded in BLOOD.
2-17-1989) => (Revised Scene Numbers
STRACK JR. => lifts his father. Emotion etched on every line of his face, he cradles the old corpse in his arms, lifting him off the black cable, and the ringing sound is finally silenced.
DARKNESS => Julie ascending a flight of shadowy stairs. The steps creak as she climbs them. We hear the eerie drip, drip, dripping of a water pipe.
JULIE => is uneasy. She halts halfway up the stairs to listen. We hear only the scurry of cautiously.
JULIE => Peyton?
CLICK => a photic-sensor picks up the disturbance.
SPEAKERS => extrude slowly from slots over the windows.
A VOICE => fills the room. It is a hollow Voice that echos about the lab.
VOICE => Please be seated. A spotlight SNAPS on, illuminating a chair behind her. Numbly, she sits in it.
A SCREEN => tak l in of her. Tvoice tak cati nal essono heomonotonousltone ofoatnarrator ofhedu films.
VOICE => ve. ow does it work? A Westlake Yanigita presentation. A smile spreads across Julie's face.
52 CONTINUED => A slide is projected on the screen. It shows a sunset over the ocean. Very corny, distorted music over this shot.
VOICE => Love. Science is perplexed over this great mystery. Shot of Peyton and Yakitito in white lab coats, identical looks of perplexity on their, faces. Julie laughs.
VOICE => What are the causes of love? How do we detect its presence? What are its effects? These are some of the questions we will investigate in this lesson. Again the sunset and distorted music.
VOICE => Part one. je origins 21 ve. The sunset is replaced by split-screen photos of Peyton and Julie, age twelve. Peyton peers into a test-tube through glasses too big for his face. Julie assumes a mock-debonair pose for the camera.
VOICE => These lovers first met on a seventh grade field trip to the planetarium... Shot of the night sky, rich with stars and galaxies.
VOICE => While the narrator discussed the origins of the universe, Peyton held Julie's hand. Shot of a somewhat nerdy Peyton with his arm stiffly around Julie.
JULIE => You were so slick.
VOICE => Our test-subjects were soon--to use the jargon of teenagers--"going out. " This "going out" period can be as short as a single date, or as long as a lifetime. Montage of Peyton and Julie throughout the years.
VOICE => In the case of these two--a rare phenomenon--it lasted twenty years.
JULIE => Although we broke up sixteen times. Sunset and distorted music.
TUA => Part two. Mating rumpled bed, The sunset is replaced by a shot of Julie on a working on legal briefs, a camera-faced shadow crossing the image.
VOICE => Certain objects develop a special, shared meaning to lovers. Here are some objects significant to our test subjects. Shot of coffee-rings on a table.
VOICE => The coffee rings Peyton tends to leave. They irritate Julie, and he leaves them everywhere! Quick shots. Coffee rings on a lab report. Coffee rings on a book-shelf. Coffee rings on a wall and ceiling. Julie laughs.
VOICE => Yet such minor irritations can strangely become endearing to the other mate.
JULIE => Not just yet they haven't. The slide changes to a shot of a bottle covered in wax.
VOICE => The bottle of Dom Perignon Champagne Julie gave Peyton for his twenty-first birthday. Now it serves as a candle holder.
JULIE => I never gave you that. The champagne bottle is replaced by a shot of a record album turning on a player. The music plays over the image. Haunting. Romantic.
VOICE => Finally, the single Love in the ark The song continues. Julie smiles, swept away by it.
VOICE => This song was playing when the two first kissed. A high school prom picture comes up on the screen. Peyton in an awkwardly fitting tux and Julie, a blossoming beauty. In the slide, they have been caught kissing.
VOICE => Now let us leave our test-subjects. The sunset again. ov in the Dark theme plays over it,. and eventually fades away.
VOICE => Love. It's fundamental nature still eludes modern Science. Yet researchers across the globe continue to study this ancient and powerful phenomenon. Hoping one day, to unlock love's mystery. Credits come on. A Westlake/Yanagita Presentation. Etc. Peyton The lights in the lab come on. Julie turns around. steps out from behind the slide projector.
PEYTON => Pretty stupid, huh?
JULIE => I thought it was beautiful-
PEYTON => Yakitito helped. I just wanted you to see it. It was just something I wanted you to. . know.
JULIE => I know. Peyton wraps his arms about her. Julie moves close and they kiss.

JULIE => .Dale Gorson, please... Peyton's hand enters with a mug of coffee, which he sets on the papers in front of her.
JULIE => Peyton! Julie takes the mug away; it has indeed left a brown circle on the topmost memo. Julie smiles at him. Then:
JULIE => Dale? Yes, Julie Hastings... yes, I found some memos researching the Von Hoffenstein deal that I don't think I was supposed to find... From the late Mr. Strack to a guy named Claude Bellasarious. They're records of payments to various people on the zoning commission... Peyton, behind her, massages her back.
JULIE => .They look like payoffs. Suspicious, at the very least... Well, the way I'd like to proceed is to talk to Strack's son first... Give him the benefit of the doubt. Under the circumstances, it's the least I can do. She hangs up. Peyton kisses her. She leans back into his arms and closes her eyes blissfully. Reluctantly, she rises and slips on her shoes. Peyton watches her admiring everything about her. She gracefully lays her legal papers in her briefcase and heads for the door. Half way out the door she turns to Peyton.
55 CONTINUED => Bye. I'll call l you tonight. Maybe we can get together. She exits.
PEYTON => The sound of the closing door echos. He sits alone on the ksd, looking about the empty apartment and lab beyond.
JULIE => In an impressive corporate power suit, briefcase in hand, walks briskl y down the sunny sidewalk, stopping at the intersection to sig nal a cab Suddenly, running up behind her..
PEYTON => Julie, wait! She is opening the cab door when she turns to him.
JULIE => What's the matter?
PEYTON => I've been thinking. Maybe we should get married.
JULIE => Marriage--well, we could do that--of course, there's our careers--I men, I'm just starting to get things going at the firm. And, you know, I kind of like having my own
PEYTON => 'We're practically living together now. All marriage means is you answer the phone in the and if you to pretend grandmother, it's a wrong number. The poor woman's beginning to think she has alzheimer's.
PEYTON => Julie, I'm asking you to marry me.
CABBIE => He got a ring?
END A => Peyton, you didn't go ou anp d you? lot of money on a ring, di
PEYTON => Ring? Oh, no, I don't have a ring.
PEYTON => I mean, I just now finally
JULIE => I love you, Peyton... She climbs into the cab, closes the door.
PEYTON => -Realized how much--
JULIE => (through the open
WINDOW) => but I guess I'm not ready. 64 Julie leans close to kiss him, but the cab pulls into 64 traffic.
JULIE => Watches Peyton grow smaller as the cab moves off. Julie looks longingly back at Peyton. Did she make the right choice? She back once more for Peyton but he is only a tiny dot in the distance.
STRACK => Yes, go ahead, put a buy on the Kugerands... Thank you for your sympathy, Franz. He was a great man. And as long as Strack Industries flourishes my father lives on. The pull back shows Strack behind his power desk, talking nd Strack into the phone. waves the person on into his lush corporatecoffice
STRACK => .Very good. Thank you. He hangs up.
STRACK => .Miss Hastings. Have a seat.
JULIE => Thank you for seeing me, Mr. Strack... I'm --sorry about your father. I heard last night.
STRACK => My father was a great man, and his
CAN GET => loss is felt by you something? allfof?us.
JULIE => No thank you. Mr. Strack, I've been going over some documents and I came across something that puzzled me. It's a memo from your office to a Mr. Claude Bellasarious--it went out over your father's signature. It detailed
CERTAIN PAYMENTS-- => Strack has gotten up to pace.
STRACK => Yes yes, I know the memo. Julie continues, hesitantly:
JULIE => ...It seems like the payments... were-
STRACK => They were pay-offs. To the zoning commission. Bribes, to call a spade a spade. He gives her an appraising look.
STRACK => .Does that shock you?
STRACK => But it disappoints you.
JULIE => Well it's hardly my place to--
STRACK => That's right, it's not your place. Yet I value your good opinion.
JULIE => Surely you don't expect me to endorse it.
STRACK => Course not. I'm sure my father never intended for you to know about it. I'm sorry if He's compromised you in any way. But I am asking you to understand. I'm not going to bore you with that old speech about how we all have to swim in the same pond. But you know as well as I that
STRACK => not so much as one mini-mall ever went up in this city without some grease being laid into the palms downtown. You're not naive; you know it's a cost of doing business. Ordinarily you don't have to face it. Well, I face it, and a lot worse, into acynic--that's the easy way out, and I'm tougher than that. Strack gestures towards a table-top architectural model of the Riverfront Development.
STRACK => Take a look at that model, Julie. That was my father's dream. Now it's my dream. Acres of riverfront reclaimed from decay, thousands of jobs created, a building block--a very large building block--laid for the future. Not such a bad dream, as dreams go. And if the price of realizing that dream is the occasional distasteful chore, well...
JULIE => All right, you're point is well taken. But the fact remains that I'm in possession of evidence of the commission of a crime. You can no more ask me to destroy it than I could ask you to destroy one of your buildings.
STRACK => Let me suggest this. You excuse yourself for a few minutes, go to the ladies' room, leaving your briefcase here. What happens to the memorandum while it's in my custody is my responsibility.
67 CONTINUED => Julie smiles.
JULIE => I wish it were that simple. First of all, I don't have the memo with me. Even if I did--
STRACK => It isn't safe to have that document.
JULIE => Are you threatening me?
STRACK => moves closer, touching her arm.
STRACK => I'm trying to protect you. Does.  his lips, wondering if he can tru Does the name Robert Durant mean anything to you?
JULIE => He's an underworld figure-- racketeering, drugs.
he wants. => There's a pause.
AND => Well, you're very eloquent, frankly I'm not certain what I should do. You'll have to trust me for a day or so to figure this out.
STRACK => Is that the most I can extract from you?
JULIE => For now.
STRACK => I believe it is. Well then, my dear, I'm in your hands.
HEARING => The song IM IR =E DARE Haunting. Sad. As Julie listens, she becomes more and more affected.
PEYTON => Time?
YAIKITITO => Ninety-six minute. A pause.
YAKITITO => So, did you ask her?
YAKITITO => This is unbelievable! Every day--
PEYTON => Time, Yakitito.
YAKITITO => It still ninety six minute! Sounds to me that maybe you didn't ask her. Maybe your afraid?
PEYTON => Look, I asked her. She said no, okay? Well, she actually said "I don't know". Peyton stands and stretches. The telephone rings, Peyton moves to answer it.
PEYTON => I'll get it.
JULIE => please be there Peyton.
A HAND => Juts out of the shadows and clutches at Peyton's wrist!
VOICE => Don't bother.
PEYTON => We hold on his shocked face as the phone rings and then stops.

ANOTHER LIGHT => comes on revealing Trumayne.
ANOTHER LIGHT => Rudy Guzman.
ANOTHER LIGHT => reveals the entire gang; Corky Corcoran and a grinning Smiley stand side by side. Near them, Skip. In the very back is Rick, looking a little green around the gills.

PAULY => pulls him up and slams him into the wall.
PEYTON => sags down, then hauls himself to his knees to behold:
DURANT => No foolish heroics, if you please. We have come only for documentstell us where to find the Bellasarious memorandum and we shall disappear-- like a nightmare before the breaking day.
73 CONTINUED => BAM--BAM--Pauly has grabbed him by the hair and rams his head into the wall twice.
DURANT => The Bellasaurious memorandum if you please...
PEYTON => I told you, I don't know what you're talking about! CRACKLE--Yakatito Yanagita is thrust into frame, his mouth stretched wide under the plastic bag that covers his head.
DURANT => .Should your houseboy's predicament not jog your memory, you may bid him Godspeed.
PEYTON => Stop it! Let him breathe!
PEYTON => surges forward but a vicious backhand blow from Pauly sends him back to the floor. He raises his face just as--BAM--an orange flash plays on Peyton's horrified features. THUNK! Yakatito drops into frame in front of him.

BLUE => The undifferentiated blue resolves itself, as a ripplin blue fluid, resembling the acid bath in Peyton's lab. A form emerges from it's depths; a completely bandaged head breaks the surface of the fluid.
RESIDENT => Here we have a 25-30 year-old-male, no I.D., no medical history. Fished the guy out of the river with burns covering over forty percent of his body. His hands and.face were the most severe.
RESIDENT => Ten years ago, pain from the burns would have been intolerable. The guy would have spent the rest of his screaming. Now we use the Rangeveritz technique; quite simply, we sever his spino-thalamic nerve...

RESIDENT => .and he can't even feel it. With a sharp practiced motion, he plucks out the pin.
RESIDENT => Of course, there are serious emotional side effects to this operation. When the body ceases to feel, when so much sensory input is lost, the patient becomes alienated. The mind, cut off from its regular diet of input, has a never-satisfied thirst; alienation gives rise to loneliness, anger; uncontrolled rage is not uncommon. And the rage problem is exacerbated by the chemical effect of severing the nerve. Now, surges of adrenaline flow unchecked through body and brain-- giving him the strength of dozen men. Hence the leather restraints. The resident turns and heads for the door. The interns follow behind like ducklings.
RESIDENT => Naturally, we give him every chance of recovery. He waves his hands about in futile circles letting the interns know that this is the party line.
RESIDENT => .Remain optimistic... inspire confidence... Talk to him about rehabilitation potential... Personally? I give him a nine on the buzzard scale.

STRACK => Thank you for coming. I'm glad you're here. He takes her by the arm and starts to lead her across the crowded floor.
STRACK => I haven't wanted to bother you during your period of grief, but I have to know whether you've come to a decision regarding the Belasarius Memorandum.
JULIE => The decision's been made for both of us. The papers were destroyed in the fire. I want to forget all about that--
JULIE => What?
STRACK => Do you remember when I mentioned a certain competitor of mine, Robert G. Durant?
JULIE => No. No. I've considered it. but the police ruled out arson. It burned hot. A gas fire. There was an acetylene leak -- the tiniest spark

JULIE => resents being gripped and lectured to and yet... she senses in Strack, a power and magnetism that holds her.
JULIE => I'll consider it... Strack smiles. As he sweeps her around, her eye catches something. Her face tightens.

DURANT => That would be just fine for me. We pan past the back of the Darkman's head. The - bandages have been removed. Although his face is not visible, the singed hairless back of his skull is. It is not a pretty sight.
DURANT => That would be just fine for me. The Darkman switches off the desk lamp and removes a mask from a black lightproof bag. He examines it, returns the mask to the bag, then slips it into his coat. The camera arcs around to see the bottom half of his skeletal face.

Even Hung Fat's own minable slaves sometimes ignore his wishes, and attack those people whom Hung Fat cherishes most deeply! Wahbuht, they know nothing of our golden friendship!
GUZMAN => is looking from Hung Fat to Durant/Darkman; what's wrong? Why doesn't he do something?
HUNG FAT => So until that shining day -- may it soon come! -- when I shall once again be able to honor you with bounty, I bid you goodbye! Good bye, Wahbuht! He is shaking his hand, pressing his advantage, invading his physical space and making mockery of him!
HUNG FAT => .. Wahbuht, goodbye!

STANDING DURANT/DARKMAN => What are you, deaf?! He notes a wisp of smoke and knows the jig is up. He slams the briefcase into Guzman's face -- THWACK! -- knocking him to the ground. The Darkman sprints down the sidewalk through the crowd.
REAL DURANT => climbs to his feet, holding his bleeding head. He backhands Guzman across the face--CRACK! He grabs Guzman's gun and runs after his alter-ego.
GUZMAN => woozily pulls a snub nosed .45 from his ankle holster and gamely follows.
DURANT/DARXMAN => races down the street, leaving a thin trail of yellow smoke. He halts at a busy intersection. Cars speed past. No way to cross. He turns to the sound of gunshots.
REAL DURANT => gun in hand, and closing fast. A cart filed with crates is wheeled directly in his path. Real Durant gracefully leaps atop the crates, and never letting up his rain of fire, springs from them. While in free-fall, he ejects the spent cartridge and snaps in a fresh clip. He lands . firing!
WE => in a shower
NEXT => hear the frightened scatter.
away bloody. => his wound He touches
DURANT => Got you.
THE TH33NG => is slims and translucent. Durant holds it to the light. It's the mask of his own face. It smolders and melts. He f1Ligs it away.
DURANT => notes drops of blood which lead off the platform and down into the dark subway tunnel.
RUDY => We ain't going in dere are we?! Durant pulls a tiny penlight from his pocket and leaps from the platform onto the track bed.
DURANT => holds up his hand commanding silence as-they come to an intersection of subway tunnels. Both lead into darkness. They listen, but all is quiet. They speak in hushed tones.
TRUMAYNE => Now what?
DURANT => You go that way. We'll take this one.
TRUMAYNE => doesn't look too thrilled by the prospect of being alone in the tunnels.
TRUMAYNE => Alone?
DURANT => No. Take a fucking squad of marines with you!
DURANT => tosses him the penlight. Hard. Casually he lights a cigar and continues forward.
TRUMAYNE => watches Durant and Guzman disappear down the tunnel. The sound of their footsteps recedes. Trumayne's breathing is shallow. He loosens his necktie and unbuttons his collar. He takes a breath.
TRUMAYNE => Okay.
TA-CKANG! CLANG! => Trumayne flinches. He points the penlight in the direction of the clanging sound.
IT => An empty wine bottle at his feet is illuminated. rolls to a stop against the tunnel wall. He listens. Silence.
TRUMAYNE => Gettin' jumpy. Like Rick. A faint cough comes from the blackness ahead.
TRUMAYNE => raises the penlight.
darkness ahead. => The cough again.
TRUMAYNE => heaves the bottle at the sound.
317 TRUM1 => waitsr the crash, ready to fire at anything that moves.. -
HIS => Black. No sound.
TRUMAYNE => still waiting, nerves on edge. Where's the crash?!
HIS POY => The oppressive dark.
TRUMAYNE => shudders Something in the darkness has swallowed the bottle. He begins to back out of the tunnel the way he came. He freezes in the center of a tunnel intersection at the sound of FOOTSTEPS. Crunching on gravel; Approaching. He fingers the gun's trigger. Empty tunnels on all sides. The FOOTSTEPS quicken.
TRUMAYNE => Mr. Durant?! Panicked, Trumayne shines his light in front of him. Empty tunnel. The FOOTSTEPS come faster, closer.
TRUMAYNE => Guzman?! He jerks his penlight to the tunnel behind him. Nothing.
317 CONTINUE- => To his right... nothing. To his left... nothing. He's trying to see all the tunnels at once. He spins desperately, firing into each of them.
GUN BARREL => spits flame--BLAM!
A TUNNEL => is illuminated by the brilliant flash of the gun. Empty. The light fades.
GUN BARREL => spins and fires -- BOOM!
TRUMAYNE'S EYES => are lit up. Crazed with fear. The illumination fades.
GUN BARREL => spins and spits sparks--BEAM!
ANOTHER TUNNEL => illuminated--empty. The light fades.
P318 => P318 TUNNEL
GUZMAN'S EYES => look like saucers.
DURANT => even looks a little scared.
GUZMAN => Oh shit, man. What did he do, man... eat him? From the tunnel ahead, FOOTSTEPS approach. The two men squint, attempting to pierce the blackness.
GUZMAN => Trumayne?! The FOOTSTEPS grow louder. Closer.
GUZMAN => .Hey, amigo, dat chew?! From the darkness, a figure emerges and runs at them.
BLAMMITY-BLAM! => The dark figure, lurches and collapses upon the ties. A shaft of light reveals it to be...
TRUMAYNE => gagged, with his hands tied behind his back, a wild look of terror in his dead eyes.
DURANT => looks about, gets control, loads a fresh clip into his gun with an echoing SNAP.
GUZMAN => waves his arms in surrender.
GUZMAN => Good Bye. Das it. I'm outta here... Durant grabs him.
DURANT => Where the hell are you going?
GUZMAN => pulls free.
WOOOOOOODOOOOOOOOOOOOOI!1!!11 => Durant looks wildly over his shoulder as he runs for his life.
VR00000000MI => The train begins its long roar past. We hear an AGONIZED SCREAM that is either the train or Durant -- or some ungodly combination.
WHITE. => from the light pouring out the passing train windows.
TRAIN WHEELS => throw blue sparks into the darkness.
LOW ANGLE => The long subway train rolls into the distance. It's rumble fades. Quiet. Durant's cigar smoulders on the tracks.
JULIE => We cut from Darkman's ravaged monster-face to:
333 JULIE => beautiful as ever.
JULIE => -- Peyton! Where have you been? Why haven't you called?
MERRY-GO-ROUND HORSES => Various close shots of leering horses bobbing up and down. We are at a carnival.
PEYTON => laughing, his face restored, walking down the midway, one arm draped over Julie's shoulder. She laughs with him. Peyton glances at his watch.
JULIE => Put away that watch or I'll think you don't like me anymore. Oh, Peyton, let's spend the whole day together -- the whole week! A beat.
PEYTON => I've got to tell you, Julie... I've got to tell you something about -- about me -- how I've changed. Julie turns.
PEYTON => In the fire -- I -- I A voice offscreen rises above the general noise:
VOICE => See the mutant man, half man, half beast! Witness this prodigy of science with your own eyes! Peyton whirls around.
JULIE => What?
NERVOUS) => Never mind.
JULIE => What's going on, Peyton? What are you keeping from me?
335 CONT => Peyton Ares at Julie. He can't bring himself to tell her.
IMPULSIVE) => C'mon, I'm going to win you the biggest' fuzziest pinkiest animal doll on that rack. Something you'll-be truly embarrassed to own... and then I've got to run. They have stopped in front of a booth where softballs get tossed at bottle pyramids. Peyton lays down a dollar and is handed three balls.
JULIE => Why do you always have to run? Peyton looks at the pyramid, avoiding her look. He throws the first ball; misses. -
PEYTON => I. have my treatment... I'm not a hundred percent cured yet--but I soon will be. He throws the second ball; misses.
JULIE => Can I take you back to the burn center? Peyton's vein begins to throb faintly.
PEYTON => No! No, please. I don't want you to see me there. I don't want you to think of me as...an invalid or... some kind of f--ff-fff--FREAK! On that word he throws the last ball with great force. The pyramid explodes. Peyton, breathing heavily, takes a moment to collect himself, then says quietly to the booth attendant:
PEYTON => ...The pink elephant, please. The bored attendant, a cigarette dangling from his lower lip, shakes his head.
ATTENDANT => Sorry buddy. It don't count if you ain't standing behind that line.
PEYTON => I was behind the line.
ATTENDANT => Not hardly.
PEYTON => I was standing right here. Next to my girlfriend. Now. The pink elephant, .if you please!
ATTENDANT => Na way. Julie tugs at his sleeve.
JULIE => Peyton, it doesn't matter. Peyton is fighting to contain his rage. in clipped words, between gasps for breath:
PEYTON => It matters. I won a pink elephant. For my girlfriend.
JULIE => Peyton... It's okay...
ATTENDANT => Get lost, buddy.
339 PEYTONN => Shaking under the pressure of contained rage, his vein bulging, throbbing. Under his-breath:
PEYTON => The elephant... Quickly! The attendant unwisely pushes two fingers into Peyton's chest. We rocket into a close shot of the offending digits. From of fscreen, we hear the attendant's voice:
ATTENDANT => You heard me, weirdo. Get lost!
341 CRACK! => The counter dissolves into a million fissures, as do the stuffed animals on the shelves above.
PEYTON => Screaming. A skin blister bubbles on his cheek.
348 WIDER => The attendant screams. Peyton screams with him. Julie screams as well.
351 PEYTON => shoves it at Julie. In a voice hoarse with rage:
PEYTON => Take it!
JULIE => Peyton! No!
PEYTON => 'Take it!
JULIE => Please!
PEYTON => Forgive me! He runs off, the fuzzy pink elephant still clasped, forgotten, beneath one arm.
JULIE => Peyton!
DARXMAN => disappears around a corner, trailing thin wisps Of smoke.
JULIE => Peyton?! 364 No answer. She cautiously advances. Her eyes fall 364 upon something that makes her gasp.
place. => 366 He moves forward towards a darkened corner of 366 the lab.
FEAR) => Peyton?! I need to talk to you. She halts at a site in front of her.
JULIE => Dear God.
370 JULIE => backs away frightened, right into.
371 JULIE => her hand trembles as she lifts the eyeless face into frame. She forces herself to examine it closely. Her the revulsion gives way to pity. She brings it into beam of light.
374 DARKMAN => Presses bimself into the shadows.
JULIE => Peyton. .?
375 DARKMAN => turns his head sharply. Only the upper right corner of his face falls into the light. The handsome, undamaged portion.
JULIE => Why didn't you tell me? If you loved me, why didn't you tell me?
376 DARKMAN => shamed, to be both coward and monster, clutches his bony hand to his skull.
JULIE => You had no right--
JULIE => coward!
JULIE => Do you think it was the face I cared about?! Is that how little you think of me?! Why didn't you come to me?
379 DARKMAN => He is shaken by a silent sob. More of his face falls into light, illuminating leathery neck muscles and hideous bone.
JULIE => I would have helped you. She stares into the shadows a long time without speaking.
JULIE => Don't you know I love you, Peyton? And no matter what--no matter what you've become I'll always love you?
DAR KHAN => (too quietly to
HEAR) => Julie... (then louder; in Julie.
floor. => Like a swan he dives. He rolls, luxuriating in the feel of gold against flesh, laughter bubbling from his lips. Gold coins stick to his flushed, sweating flesh, then slough off, leaving their imprint. Strack makes swimming motions with his arms, laving himself with the golden coins-- A knock at the door. Strack freezes.
STRACK => Huhh??:!
VOICE => Julie Hasting's to see you, Mr. Strack.
383 CONTINU => Strack43 eyes dart nervously to the door.
THROAT) => Very well... He stands. A coin or two falls from his dimpled ass as he reaches down for his pants.
STRACK => Julie, how sweet of you to come before our appointed hour... but I expected-- you in something a little more formal. Didn't Ruth inform you that we have tickets to Der Fliedermause tonight?
JULIE => I can't go, Louis. We have to talk.
STRACK => Excellent! I love to talk. Brandy?
JULIE => Thank you, no.
STRACK => I'll have one;_ As he walks to a bar and pours himself a drink.
STRACK => ...Fair warning--it's Napoleon, and it's quite good--
JULIE => Louis, I can't see you anymore.
STRACK => Darling, settle down. Don't be rash. As you say, let's talk.
JULIE => You know about Peyton, the man I was
JULIE => Louis, he's alive. He's back. He was burned, horribly, horribly burned--I don't understand what happened but I know he needs my help. Strack is visibly taken aback. He sets the brandy down.
STRACK => .Your news has a bittersweet flavor... Of course I'm very happy for you. If there's anything I can do-- the finest medical care can be at your disposal--burn therapy, recon- structive surgery. How badly was he... mutilated? Julie has broken down. She sits down on Strack's sofa, her body wracked with sobs.
STRACK => ... Where is he, Julie?
JULIE => He's living in an abandoned warehouse. He's alone... he needs me. The phone RINGS. Strack crosses to the desk and picks it up.
STRACK => Not now!... Who?... All right, I'll take it in the other room. He looks up at Julie.
STRACK => I won't be a moment. He walks into an adjoining room. He picks up the phone.
STRACK => Yes, Franz... And the closing price?...
JULIE => She reaches for a tissue. Next to it is.
HER POV => Strack's briefcase sitting on top of his desk.
JULIE => Wipes a tear from her eyes. She moves closer.
STRACK => I feel sufficiently diversified... Franz, it is immaterial to me what the market is doing. I want you to buy...
JULIE'S POV => A sheaf of papers stick up above the mouth of the briefcase.
STRACK => Yes, you did hear me correctly. I want you to buy. Ten thousand Krugerands. Fresh ones!
STRACK => Yes. The Belasarious memorandum.
JULIE => whirls to face him. He stands looking down over her shoulder.
STRACK => .I'm sorry you had to find that, dear. Our relationship didn't need this further strain.
JULIE => The fire... it wasn't an accident, it was you.
STRACK => Not me personally. I have an employee who does certain things for me, unofficially, off the books. Robert doesn't like to pay taxes.
STRACK => Hardly. You have nothing on me, my dear, and you'd find the extremely expensive police department quite unsympathetic. . Julie. Consider the big picture.
STRACK => I suppose this is goodbye then. Julie stares hatefully at him for a beat, then hurries out the door.
STRACK => Send Robert in. Strack strolls over to the window and stares out at his rising city. OS the door clicks open.
I STRACK => Robert! I have good news and bad.
DURANT => Custom dictates that you render the bad news first.
STRACK => You recall the little difficulty with my father and how you resolved it. We have a similar situation with Miss Hastings. It seems Miss Hastings has uncovered some unflattering information about us.
DURANT => No problem at all. And the good news?
STRACK => Your wife died. I'm joking, of course. No, the good news is that I know who's behind our little troubles of late. When you retrieved my memorandum, you failed to excise the good doctor.
DURANT => Westlake? He's dead. I saw to it myself.
STRACK => He's alive. I don't like loose ends, Robert. Finish it.
DURANT => Okay. Where is he? Strack smiles.
STRACK => I believe we have a guide.
JULIE => turns to run.
JULIE => Peyton!! Guzman races out of one continental, Smiley out the other.
JULIE! => He races toward the door.
BUDDA-BUDDA-BUDDA!! => The rooftop is riddled by bullets.
A HELICOPTER => rises suddenly into frame, over the edge of Peres a roof. leaning , o undin h h machine gun , p g t e roof with gunfire.
DURANT => Peg 'em!
A DOOR => is kicked open as Smiley and Guzman enter, guns ps blazing, shooting the lab to hell. The gunfire sto and the lab is quiet. Guzman speaks quietly into a walkee-talkee.
GUZMAN => we're in.
TALKEE) => He just went down from the roof.
GUZMAN => Glances above to the darkened rafters ofathence one to warehouse. Then, signals for Smiley way. He will go another. They split up.
GUZMAN => ...Holy San Juan de fuckeen Capistrano!
403 SMILEY => moves through the dimly lit lab area. Gun out, checking every crevice.
TALKEE) => Come in, Smiley, come in! Come--
THE FOOTSTEPS => 405 Smiley turns off the walkee-talkee. i m. are almost atop him. He takes a
407 SMILEY => is hip to the Darkman's game. He smiles. The gun belches flame at the masked figure.
409 SMILEY => peEjz back the mask with the barrel of his gun revealing. . GUZMAN!!
410 SMILEY => loses his smile. A third Smiley stands slowly into frame behind the spooked Smiley.
SMILEY #3/DAPYMAN => Good shootin'.
TRIPLICATE AND => looks from the dead Smiley to his short as the SHRIEKS! But it's mercifully cut Darkman is upon him.
DURANT => Guzman, come in! Smiley! Guzman! What the fuck is going on down there?! A burst of STATIC. Then:
PILOT) => Take her down!
412 CONTINUED => The pilot lowers the throttle stick and
412A => 412A the chopper swoops down.
DURANT => I want that son of a bitch eliminated! And I don't want his fingers, I want his fucking head!
crouches. => They advance slowly across the room... not a sound in the darkness except their footsteps and the occasional beep of a computer... the air is tense with danger.
DURANT => Where are you?! Pilot.and Durant look toward the entrance of the warehouse. The door is closed. Suddenly...
TO => WHOMPI--a bandaged hand slams into Durant's chest grab bim and start hauling him towards the door. The Darkman is dragging him out towards the roof.
DARKMAN => is yanked from his feet.
THE HELICOPTER => climbs, lifting the Darkman clear of the rooftop.
button. => Closer... closer...
THE DEAN => is hurled through the window of an office on the 70th floor of a skyscraper.
DARKMAN'S POV => The faces of the executives whirling in a circle like numbers on a roulette wheel.
' 431 => 431 Suddenly, the faces start to recede... SMASH!... The Darkman is yanked back out the window, breaking the remaining glass.
DURANT => Dip him!
435 DARKMAN => is dipped into oncoming traffic. He barely clears the roof of a Cadillac by swinging his legs above it.
438 DARMAN => is lifted straight into the path of a fast-moving truck. Truck HONKS furiously. Darkman strains his legs. CLOSE-UP: TRACKING over the truck's aluminum roof.
439 HELIER => Looking forward over Durant's and pilot's shoulders. The:pa3at has the stick. We are rushing directly town an overpass.
B442 => B442 Wind whipping at his coat looking up at the doomed helicopter, the Darkman bellows his triumph.
P443 OVERPASS => taking up the entire screen. --impact--KABOOM!
B444 => B444 Darkman, LAUGHING on the truck, races through the darkness,
444A => 444A flaming debris from the helicopter cascading over the mouth of the tunnel.
STRACK => We've consolidated the waterfront, Governor ...Yes, I'm aware there's been some unpleasantness but that's over now. Yes, I'm sure. You sound a little nervous, Bryant. Have a brandy, watch a cop show. The door opens. A security officer appears.
SECURITY OFFICER => Robert Durant, sir.
ROBERT DURANT => enters. He looks awful--face scorched and bruised, severe limp.
STRACK => You look like hell, Robert.
DURANT => The son of a bitch malfunctioned my helicopter.
STRACK => And Westlake?
DURANT => 'f ie man's a cockroach. You think you ;tall him, and he pops up someplace , Ise. A beat.
STRACK => g expect he'll pop up here soon.
P44 => P446 stars all around us.
STRACK => I'm glad you survived, Robert. I'd hate to see your kids deprived of a role-model.
DURANT => They do look up to me. The elevator grinds to a halt and the two emerge. The lights of the city tremble over the water. A glitter and breadth to the landscape, an urban grandeur.
STRACK => Kids need an example, Robert. When I was a young man my father made me work high steel. That's how he started out, and in his view what was good enough for him was good enough for me...
P446 CONTIKUED => Strack gestures broadly with one arm.
STRACK => ...It was just me and the Indians, no one else crazy enough to run around up here, against the wind, four-fifty an hour. Sure I resented it, but now-- call me crazy--sometimes I miss it, it sharpens your wits. Life on the edge. Five inches wide. Two hundred fifty feet down. High steel... He turns to face Durant. There's a gun in his hand.
STRACK => You don't have any kids, Robert.
DURANT => What are you talking about?
STRACK => Or should I say, Doctor Westlake?
DUR ANT => I'm Durant! Robert G. Durant!
STRACK => Then I'm going to make a mistake. There's a long beat. The vein begins to pulse on Durant's temple. His eyes grow predatory, evil.
STRACK => You want to see the girl? Follow me, I'll take you to her... Durant/Darkman follows, taking the first few tentative steps.
STRACK => ...I must say, Dr. Westlake, you've certainly worked some mischief. Pretty much wiped out the security arm of Strack Industries. That's okay. I'm a good sport... He leaps from beam to beam, Durant/Darkman following cautiously behind.
STRACK => ...And I can handle my own problems. I do whatever I have to do. In fact, that's how I got my first properties. My wife--late wife--held certain deeds... I sent her on a plane trip over the Smokies and well, let's just say ;landed on My feet...
DURANT/DARKMAN => All I have are nightmares. A beat.
STRACK => Then share my dream. After all, you and I are pretty much the same. We should be working together. Both smart fellows. Similar styles. Same taste in women. I could use a man like you.
STRACK => Eventually, eventually... He proceeds nimbly along the beam.
STRACK => I guess you just don't have what it takes. I gather you run around wearing other people's faces now, since yours is so... loathsome. He shrugs.
STRACK => .See I could never do that. The world has to take me as I am. And all this tit-for- tat stuff you've been up to. Silly. Living in the past. ; only destroy to build something better, whereas You.. ah, here we are.
DURANT/DARKMAN => Julie! Strack laughs.
STRACK => Bring on the strings! Young lovers! In peril! Separated by ruthless forces, larger than they!--What a banal tale. In it, I suppose I play the villain. But wait, Julie--which of us is the monster here?! With this he reaches over to Durant and--SQUISHHHRIPPP!! -- tears his face off, tossing it over the edge..
449 JULIE => gazes at Darkman's ghastly visage for the first time, overcome by horror and repulsion. Darkman's vein pulses like csa y.. Strack"s tone is almost admiring:
STR.ACK => You truly are one ugly son of a bitch.
BLAM! => Strack shoots Darkman in the shoulder, hurling him off the bean. The Darkman tumbles, limbs flailing, bellowing with rage.
THE WORLD => Spinning upside down--stars, abyss, stars, abyss--
GIRDER => As Darkman's fingertips clamp onto the upper lip of an I-beam... barely hanging on, vein pulsing.
JULIE => recoils as Strack stops in front of her. He touches her hair.
YOU-- => He places his hands on her shoulders, preparing to push her off the girder. With intensity:
STRACK => -It is the tragedy of my life that I always have to kill the ones I love. As he's about to push her:
IDuis ! => Strack turns around.
STRACK JR. => Father?
451 BAM! => Darkman mashes his face and the gun flies out of his hand into the darkness below.
OF => battle it out on the narrow girder, hundreds of feet sure death on either side of them.
DARIOM => swoops onto Strack, pummelling him.
STRACR'S HAND => inching painfully toward the rivet gun.
DARKMAN => pummelling, lost in the act of his final revenge. He steps back to give a final blow... .and slips on some loose rivets, flailing for balance.
STRACK => lunges. CLANG! Darkman slams into a vertical bar.
STRACK => Now you get to watch your girl-friend die. He moves toward a terrified Julie.
DARXMAN => SHRIEKS and reality melts around him as he tastes the hot soup of rage.
454 CRACK! => Gigantic fissures appear on all the girders... we spin into Darkman's eyeball to find--
DARKMAN => pounces. He lifts him full into the air. Strack's legs and arms flail impotently.
ARRRRRRRGGGGGGG ! => Darkman hurls him up, up into the air. 463 Strack rises helpless, flailing his limbs... then begins 463 to fall, yards away from the girder. 464 He spins, end over end, to--PPHHHHFFFTHHMP!--be impaled 464 on the rebars many floors below, next to Durant's face.
JULIE => Peyton, I can help.
DARKMAN => No one can help.
JULIE => I don't care how you look, Peyton! I. love you. The burns don't matter. There's a long pause. Then Darkman turns the twisted remains of. his face toward her. Julie sees them in close-up. CLAMP! The elevator jars to a halt on street level.
DARKMAN => Take my hand. Julie stares at the charred skeletal fingers. She overcomes her repulsion and puts her hand in his.
DARKMAN => It disgusts you.
JULIE => No. Darkman stares at her a long time, anguished, torn.
DARKMAN => This hand... it used to caress you. Now it can only tear, rip away at things.
PERSUASIVE) => But you'll perfect the skin. You'll get rid of the scars.
DARKMAN => It's not just the scars. I've changed- He grips his skull.
DARKMAN => --inside. He pulls the elevator open.
JULIE => (tears in her
EYES) => I want it back. The two of us--the way it was... Darkman's voice breaks:
DARKMAN => What we had--our life together--it belonged in the light of day. He disappears into the darkness.
JULIE => Peyton! Darkman's voice floats back as he stalks away:
DARKMAN => Peyton is gone... 466 He heads into the shadows. At the edge of the darkness 466 he pulls a mask from his coat and disappears behind a construction trailer. A pedestrian reappears on the other side. Julie knows it's!Darkman. She chases after him but he slips into the pedestrian traffic. The camera hurries down the street with Julie as she desperately searches for him, turning people around, staring at their faces... It begins to snow.
JULIE => Peyton! She rushes from pedestrian to pedestrian, staring into alien faces in search of the man she loves.
