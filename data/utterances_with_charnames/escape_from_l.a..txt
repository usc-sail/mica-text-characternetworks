FEMALE NARRATOR => Forces hostile to the United States grow strong in the late 20th Century.
FEMALE NARRATOR => A great moral crisis grips the nation as social revolution and a breakdown of the criminal justice system threaten society.
FEMALE NARRATOR => To protect and defend its citizens, the United States Police Force is formed.
FEMALE NARRATOR => The population of Los Angeles grows to 40 million. The city is ravaged by crime and immorality. A Presidential candidate predicts a millennium earthquake will destroy the city in divine retribution.
FEMALE NARRATOR => An earthquake measuring 9.6 on the Richter scale hits at 12:59 p.m., August 23rd, in the year 2000.
FEMALE NARRATOR => After the devastation, the constitution is damned, and the newly elected President accepts a lifetime term of office.
FEMALE NARRATOR => Fearing a massive terrorist invasion from South America, the United States prepares for war. The Great Wall is built along the southern border, cutting off the flow of illegal aliens.
FEMALE NARRATOR => Street gangs, South American terrorists and the criminally insane capture Los Angeles, the once-great City of Angels.
FEMALE NARRATOR => Now an island on the border of civilization, L.A. is a no-man's land of chaos, anarchy and darkness.
FEMALE NARRATOR => The United States Police Force, like an army, is encamped in the San Gabriel Mountains.
FEMALE NARRATOR => The President's first act as Permanent Commander-in-Chief is Directive 17: protect and defend the United States from this island of the damned, Hell on Earth.
POLICE ANCHOR => He's been the Force's Most Wanted Man for 10 years. Convicted of 27 moral crimes. I can tell you, the excitement around here is...  Here he comes!
BRAZEN => Commander Malloy. They're bringing him out, sir.
MALLOY => So we finally got him.
POLICE ANCHOR => Hold one! The door is opening!
POLICE ANCHOR => Hello, Plissken. Welcome to L.A.
POLICE VOICE => You are now entering the Deportation Center. You have been found guilty of moral crimes against the United States of America.
POLICE ANCHOR => S.D. Bob Plissken. Special Forces, Black Light, Texas Thunder. Two Purple Hearts. Youngest man ever decorated by the President.
POLICE ANCHOR => You've been convicted of 27 moral crimes, Plissken. The murder of an Internal Revenue agent. The kidnapping of a bank president. Gun fighting for profit. The list goes on and on...
POLICE ANCHOR => You used to respect the law. Served your country like no man before you. Role model to a generation.
POLICE ANCHOR => What happened to you, war hero? You were the best we had.
POLICE VOICE => You are sentenced to permanent expulsion beyond the borders of the U.S. You now have the option to repent of your sins and be electrocuted on the premises. If you elect this option, notify the Cleric Sergeant in your Processing Area.
POLICE ANCHOR => The whole world's watching. Every good and decent person who works and hard and follows the rules. What would say to them?
POLICE ANCHOR => What would you say to all of us who believed in you, who looked up to you, who thought you stood for right over wrong, good over evil? Be my guest. What do you have to say, Plissken?
PLISSKEN =>  Call me Snake.
BRAZEN => ComStat did a psychosearch on him. Used a database of 5 million sociopathic personalities. He hit the bottom of the curve.
MALLOY => Perfect for the mission. Nobody else can pull it off - not an army, not a man.
BRAZEN => Zero emotional developments. Total lack of compassion. A highly developed psychopathic instinct to survive.
3RD MAN => Let's get this over with.
MALLOY => How you doin' Plissken?  You like the watch?
PLISSKEN => You assholes didn't bring me here to give me this for 20 years of dedicated service. What'ya want?
3RD MAN => Get to it.
MALLOY => At 1030 hours Wednesday, a group of government officials began a tour of the Livermore Defense Lab. The President's daughter, Utopia, was among them.
MALLOY => An hour later, she boarded Air Force 3 to Washington.
UTOPIA =>  To the American people - it is time to rise up and demand the surrender of the President and his corrupt theocracy of lies and terror.
MALLOY => At 1140 hours, she hijacked the plane. We scanned the videotape on VR. Check it out.
UTOPIA => Today is Day One of a brand new world. The days of the empire are finished.  To the President - my father, you know what this is.
UTOPIA => You know what it will do. Unless you abdicate your throne by tomorrow night, I will use it - on you.
CONGRESSMAN => Utopia, please. Give us the prototype. If something should happen -
UTOPIA => It will be in my hands - and the hands of my lover.
UTOPIA => Yes, my lover. My man. The only real man I've ever known. I'm on my way to his arms.
MALLOY => Somehow during the tour, she came into possession of a prototype transmitting device. We don't know how.
BRAZEN => Utopia became depressed after her mother's suicide, began to withdraw into her virtual reality simulator. She'd punch up her own little world in cyberspace and stay in it for days at a time.  Somebody else was in there with her.
MALLOY => Cuervo Jones. Shining Path. Peruvian terrorist. Runs the biggest baddest gang in L.A.
BRAZEN => Utopia made tapes of her VR experiences, then tried to erase them. She missed this fragment on the end of her last tape. Cuervo Jones must have tapped into the VR master data bank - and then went prowling around for innocent blood, someone vulnerable to corrupt. Utopia was lonely, looking for something to believe in.
PLISSKEN => Sad story. You got a cigarette?
MALLOY => Shut up, Plissken.
PLISSKEN => What's the little black box do?
MALLOY => Top secret. Only on a need to know.
PLISSKEN => And I don't need to know. So fuck you, I'm goin' to Hollywood.
MALLOY => That's right, big shot. Unless you do what we want you're not coming back.
PLISSKEN => So what's the deal, huh? Go into L.A., find the President's daughter, secure the box, and bring 'em both out - and I'm free?
MALLOY => That's the deal.
PLISSKEN => Tell the President to adopt. I think I'll like L.A.
3RD MAN => If you bring out the prototype, you'll receive a full pardon for every immoral act you have ever committed in the United States. Just like in '97. Remember New York, Plissken?
PLISSKEN =>  Who are you?
MALLOY => It's the President, for Christ's sake!
PRESIDENT => I give you my word. Put the prototype into my hands, and you're a free man.
PLISSKEN => I can see you're real concerned about your daughter.
PRESIDENT => Utopia is lost to me. My daughter is gone.
PLISSKEN => Well, I'll think it over.
PRESIDENT => You're running out of time.
PLISSKEN => I've been doin' that all my life. Might as well do it in L.A. Everybody else there is.
MALLOY => Well, enjoy it, war hero, cause you got 10 hours to live.
PLISSKEN => Wait a minute, what are you talkin' about?
MALLOY => Having second thoughts?
PLISSKEN => Maybe. But you're not putting any shit in me this time.
MALLOY => You don't understand. It's already in you.
MALLOY => The cigarette girl in New Vegas was an undercover cop. She injected you with incentive toxin. Right now it's swimming in your bloodstream. It'll start to take effect in 9 hours.
BRAZEN => It's a strain of the Plutoxin 7 virus. Genetically engineered. 100% pure death. Complete nervous system shutdown. You crash and bleed out like a stuck pig. Not a pretty sight.
MALLOY => Of course there's an anti-toxin. Neutralizes the virus immediately upon injection.  We'll give it to you, but you have to do us this little favor.
PRESIDENT => Didn't think we were that stupid, did you?
MALLOY => We're holographs.
PLISSKEN => Get this crap out of me.
MALLOY => I guess we have a deal. Nice to be working with you, Plissken.
PLISSKEN =>  Call me Snake.
BRAZEN => Very sweet little weapon. Core burner. Magnesium ammo. 500 extra rounds.  Two 9mm handguns.  Oral projectile. Mouth dart. Hold it in your mouth for ten seconds, the coating dissolves, it becomes a weapon.
BRAZEN => Urolite. It'll stun the enemy for several seconds.
MALLOY => Tracer. Utopia has a kidnap chip implanted in her arm. You can locate her with this.
BRAZEN => This clips right onto your 9mm. Ammo enhancers. Like miniaturized grenades. Blows through anything.
MALLOY => L.A. is in a constant state of warfare. Gangs fighting for the right to rule.
BRAZEN => Heavy Third World connections. They get weapons, drugs, fuel, choppers - everything is pumped into the island from the south.
MALLOY => Some areas have power - they're on line to San Onofre.
PLISSKEN => I'll need to know more about this thing.
MALLOY => Only a handful of people are aware of its existence. Let's just say it's the ultimate defensive weapon.
PLISSKEN => Defense against what?
MALLOY => There's a war about to be declared, or didn't you know?
MALLOY => Third World wants to live like we do - and they plan on taking what they want. The Cubans and Brazilians are ready to invade Miami. If the Africans and Colombians make a run at the border, we got a full scale attack on the United States.
PLISSKEN => So what does this thing do?
MALLOY => All you need to know is get it back here by 5 a.m.
MALLOY =>  You're going over by submarine. One-man submersible. Nuclear powered.
PLISSKEN => Where do I put ashore?
MALLOY => Cahuenga Pass. Make your way up through the mountains toward the Hollywood Bowl. You should be able to pick up Utopia's tracer there.  Once you go inside, you're on your own.  You know what you have to do with the girl, don't you?  We have to spare this nation her trial - for treason.
PLISSKEN => So you want me to take her out?  Is that an order from the President?
MALLOY => Let's just say it's what's best for the country.
PLISSKEN => By the way - who gives me the anti-toxin?
MALLOY => A medical team will be standing by.
PLISSKEN => Not you?
MALLOY => No.
PLISSKEN => Good.
MALLOY => Thought you might try that. First clip is filled with blanks. Goodbye, Plissken.
PLISSKEN => Com check.
MALLOY => I'm here, Plissken.
MALLOY => Stand by for launch. Ignitor.  Fuel rod injection.
PLISSKEN => She's in the green.
MALLOY => Lock fuel rods.
PLISSKEN =>  Locked.
MALLOY => Nuclear turbine to 75% power.
PLISSKEN => 75% power.
MALLOY => Hands on switches and counting. 5...4...3...2...1. Launch.
MALLOY => Plissken, watch your speed. Lots of obstructions down there.
MALLOY => Plissken...
MALLOY => Plissken... do you copy?
BRAZEN => His reactor's starting to overheat.
MALLOY => Plissken, slow down the sub. You're overloading the power plant.
MALLOY => Plissken...?
MALLOY => Plissken...?
PLISSKEN => I'm here.
MALLOY => Where's the submarine? It's disappeared off our screens.
PLISSKEN => It's history. I gotta go.
PIPELINE => Too bad about your boat, man.  Supposed to be some swells out here tonight. Big ones.  You like to surf?
PIPELINE => You look kinda familiar.  You hang out around here much?
PIPELINE => Hey, man. I know who you are. You're Snake Plissken. Man, I can't believe you're really here.
PIPELINE => Kind of a bad neighborhood, Snake.
PLISSKEN => Which way to the Hollywood Bowl?
PIPELINE =>  Down that way.
PIPELINE => Be careful. Some real strange dudes hangin' out there these days.
PIPELINE => Hey Snake - what're you doin' around here, man?  I heard they busted you up real good in Cleveland...
A VOICE => Shut-up, fuck! Stop makin' noise!
SPINAL => Take cover, fool.
SPINAL => Let's take him.
SPINAL => Hey. I know you. Snake Plissken.
SPINAL => Hey, what's going down, Snake?
PLISSKEN => I'm looking for somebody.
SPINAL => Who ain't?
SPINAL => Say, is it true what they say about Cleveland, man?
SPINAL => Later, Snake. Thanks for the help. You can always shift down and mojo with us anytime.
BLONDE HOOKER => It's winnin' time, baby. How about you and I do some celebrating?
PLISSKEN => What's going on?
BLONDE HOOKER => You must be new around here.  You look familiar. Have I done you before?
PLISSKEN => What's happening?
BLONDE HOOKER => Easy, man, easy. It's Cuervo Jones' gang. Mescalito Justice. He's the big boss man 'round here tonight.  He's gonna take down the police and make 'em kiss his fine ass.
CUERVO JONES => Snake Plissken.
CUERVO JONES => Later, Snake. We finish it later.
VOICE => Snake Plissken, right?
PLISSKEN => Where'd they go?
PLISSKEN => Where are they?
PLISSKEN => Location.
SENTRY =>  Specimen moving west on Sunset.
GATEKEEPER => Halt!  Where are you going?  Are you here for the auction?
GATEKEEPER => Welcome to Beverly Hills.
TASLIMA => Hi, Snake. It's so great to meet you. My name's Taslima. I'm a fan of yours.
PLISSKEN => Are you crazy?
TASLIMA => A little bit. But pretty soon I'm gonna be dead. So are you, Snake.
TASLIMA => I can't believe I got caught.  I run with Midnight Jihad. Iranian gang. Only they kicked me out, cause I screw up sometimes. I forget stuff.
TASLIMA => I left my boyfriend's place tonight, took a wrong turn...  Oh, Snake, I'm really kind of out of it sometimes.
PLISSKEN => What are they?
TASLIMA => They live here, used to be like us. But after too many silicon implants, their muscles turned to jelly. The only way they survive is to have body parts transplanted over and over again.  Snake, nobody who comes into Beverly Hills gets out alive.
PLISSKEN => No screamin' shit.
TASLIMA => Oh no, it's the Doctor.
PLISSKEN => Who?
TASLIMA => The Surgeon General of Beverly Hills.
THE DOCTOR => I've never seen more beautiful specimens. There will be no auction tonight. These body parts will go to those who need them the most.
THE DOCTOR => What a beautiful blue eye. It's a shame you only have one.
TASLIMA => Snake, help me.
SNAKE => Why?
TASLIMA => I don't know.
PLISSKEN => Don't follow me.
TASLIMA => You need help.
PLISSKEN => Like hell I do.
TASLIMA => Down this way.
PLISSKEN => This is a dead end.  You took us into a dead end!
TASLIMA => I just thought you wanted to get away. I didn't know you wanted to go someplace.
PLISSKEN => Go!
TASLIMA => Be careful of the bald cats. They live in these buildings.
PLISSKEN => The what?
PLISSKEN =>  Are you gonna stand there? Give me the gun!
PLISSKEN => How do we get out of here?
TASLIMA => Sewers. Come on.
TASLIMA => Down there.
TASLIMA => Snake - what is it?
PLISSKEN => How the hell am I supposed to know? This is your damn city.
PENDEJO BOB => What're you doing in here?
PLISSKEN => Looking to get out.
PENDEJO BOB => Good. I want you out. This is my sewer.
PLISSKEN => Which way?
PENDEJO BOB => You're Snake Plissken.
TASLIMA => Yes. Isn't he cool?
PENDEJO BOB => An honor, Snake. Amigo. They call me Pendejo Bob.
PENDEJO BOB => Those damn patients are coming back. You'd better climb aboard.
PENDEJO BOB => I use the eye and the music to scare em off. They're so whacked out, man, it works great. Chased a whole bunch of em right off the edge there a few months ago.
TASLIMA =>  How far down does it go?
PENDEJO BOB => Don't know - never do hear em land. Earthquake opened it up.
PENDEJO BOB => I own this whole place. Used to work here in the old days. I was right in this room when the big one hit. What a mess. We were waist high in shit.  Everybody else ran, but not me. I stayed at my post. Now it's all mine. I brought my whole family, my amigos, down here to live with me.
TASLIMA => Gun runners.
PENDEJO BOB => Hey, it's a living, baby.
PLISSKEN => Why don't you get out of L.A.? Take a boat to China, take an airplane to Brazil?  Earthquakes, death, shit. Why do you stay?
TASLIMA => I don't know. Somehow, I just can't leave.
PENDEJO BOB => Y'know, L.A.'s not such a bad place, Snake. We got our problems, sure - but this is paradise, man.
PENDEJO BOB => Say, you need anything, Snake? Guns? Explosives? I can get you a crate of hellfire grenades, no problem - five hours.
PLISSKEN => Yeah. So how do I get to Venice?
PENDEJO BOB => All the sewers are collapsed under Venice. You have to go topside. Right up there.
PENDEJO BOB => Comes out near the Santa Monica Freeway. Just follow the signs. Get off at the Lincoln Exit, turn left.
PENDEJO BOB => Nice to meet you, Snake. You too, Miss. You're welcome down here anytime. Anytime at all.
TASLIMA => The freeway's over there. But, Snake - I don't think it's such a good idea.
TASLIMA => The freeways are dangerous.
TASLIMA => Goodbye, Snake.
TASLIMA => Sun's coming up in a few hours.
TASLIMA => UV's gonna be bad today. I have a friend who's got a place near here. We can crash there if you want, Snake.  I'd love to take care of you. Make you feel good.
TASLIMA => I changed my mind. I'm going with you, wherever you're going.
PLISSKEN =>  What the hell is this?
TASLIMA => The freeway.
PLISSKEN => I know that. There are people in some of these cars.
TASLIMA => It's where they live. I guess after everything happened, they just needed to do what they'd always done before. During the daytime, they just pull down the shades on their windows and sleep.
TASLIMA => What are you gonna do in Venice?
PLISSKEN => Find Cuervo Jones.
TASLIMA => No! Stay away, Snake. He's mucho muerte.
TASLIMA => Run, Snake...They're coming.
PLISSKEN => Who?
TASLIMA => I don't know.
PLISSKEN => Delgado?
PLISSKEN => Stop the damn car.
PLISSKEN => I said pull over.
PLISSKEN => Where is it?
CUERVO JONES => We'll see.
CUERVO JONES => Carrot juice?  Laced with tequila, Snake. Good for you. No?  Your health.
CUERVO JONES => You're coming out of it, Snake. It hurts real bad.  That's good.
CUERVO JONES => Dying isn't good enough for you. You need pain. You'll never make it to where you want to go without a little pain.
CUERVO JONES => Snake Plissken. American outlaw. So typical of American idealism. The old west, Snake.
CUERVO JONES => Man against the sky. The individual. Freedom. No wonder they hate you so much in America, Snake. You remind them of what they used to be.
CUERVO JONES => Here is the real L.A., Snake.
CUERVO JONES => The poor. The old. The lost. People without hope.
CUERVO JONES => Do you know what they want? One word. Liberation.  They want a chance to live - before it's all gone. They've been hated for too long  Now it's their turn.
UTOPIA => Cuervo! LaToya Jackson just won Best Actress.
UTOPIA => You said I could hold it.
UTOPIA => Who's that?
CUERVO JONES => You never heard of Snake Plissken?
UTOPIA => He doesn't look like his picture.  I bet he's fake.
CUERVO JONES => Now go get dressed. We have things to do.
UTOPIA => Are we going to eat soon? I'm starved.
UTOPIA => Ooww!
CUERVO JONES => Go on now. Do as I say.
CUERVO JONES => I'm going to show her what it means to be a woman - for the first time in her pathetic little life.  Given her love, Snake. Everybody needs love.
CUERVO JONES => You want to hook up with us? Join the revolution? We're all getting out of here tomorrow night.  We're gonna rule the world. Come with us, Snake.
CUERVO JONES => No? Too bad. Well, I told you we'd finish it later. So guess what? It's later.
DELGADO => You're mine now, Snake. All mine.
PLISSKEN => Shit.
ANNOUNCER =>  Shot clock!
JAMAAL => Hey - Snake Plissken, you knew my brother Abdul. He was with you in Cleveland.
JAMAAL => Welcome aboard, Snake.
CUERVO JONES => The time is now. We are the strongest. If we go together, the others will come.  We go for everything, Xi-Ping. But we go together. What do you say?
PLISSKEN => Your brother died owing me, so I'm taking it out in trade. I need a favor...
JAMAAL => Sure, Snake. Anything.
PLISSKEN => I need to get across the court now... without drawing attention to myself.
JAMAAL => Like you ain't gonna stick out like a sore thumb. But we'll do what we can, Snake. Use the clock. Screen and roll. Now let's kick some butt!
JAMAAL =>  You play much pick-up ball, Snake?
JAMAAL => Whatever happens, watch the shot clock, man.
UTOPIA => It's that weird guy again.
JAMAAL => Snake! Shot clock!
CUERVO JONES => That man in black. He's very dangerous.
XI-PING => One eye?
CUERVO JONES => Yes. We gotta dump him.
XI-PING => What does he want?
CUERVO JONES =>  I'm betting the cops sent him in. Man, I do not need this. I got a war to win.
PLISSKEN => Where are they going?
PLISSKEN => Not yet.
CUERVO JONES => No!
UTOPIA => Lemme go...!
CUERVO JONES => Kill him, kill him...!
UTOPIA => My... father sent you... didn't he?  He sent you to kill me...
UTOPIA => Didn't he? 
PLISSKEN => Shit.
PLISSKEN => Get out of here.
PLISSKEN => I said go!
UTOPIA => Don't take it back. Don't give it to him. Please. Let me have it.
PLISSKEN => What does this thing do?
UTOPIA =>  No!
CUERVO JONES => Where is he?
CUERVO JONES => Give it to me.
CUERVO JONES =>  Give it.
PROTOTYPE VOICE =>  I am now armed and ready for use. Use extreme caution. The location of the effected blast area can only be determined by the orbital position of the SatStar Ring.
CUERVO JONES => This is turning out to be my lucky day. (stares coldly at Map To The Stars Eddie) Get this asshole outta here.
UTOPIA => Cuervo...?
CUERVO JONES => You're my woman, you understand? You don't let anybody take you away from me without a fight.
UTOPIA => I tried...
CUERVO JONES =>  Nobody leaves Cuervo Jones. Not unless you give your life. You fight till you're dead. Then I forgive you.  Understand?  Understand?
UTOPIA => Yes...
CUERVO JONES => Let's go.
CUERVO JONES =>  Look, baby. They're all mine.
POLICE VOICE => Full stage battle alert. All personnel to battle stations.
MALLOY => A sky full of enemy choppers on radar. Moving over the city to the southeast.
COM OFFICER => Commander - massive vehicle and troop movement on the ground. All major streets leading to the southeast.
PRESIDENT => What're they doing?
MALLOY => Getting ready to invade.
PRESIDENT =>  So where's Plissken?
PENDEJO BOB => Hey, Snake. You okay?  I heard gunfire down here...  Never been down this far before... (swings the rope in a huge arc) Grab this.
PENDEJO BOB => Now hang on.
PENDEJO BOB => Hey, Snake...where are you?
PLISSKEN =>  I'm in another opening... Storm drain... There may be another way up to you...
PENDEJO BOB => Snake...  Snake!
PIPELINE => Snake. Saw you at the game tonight. Great shot.  You look like shit.
PIPELINE => You feel those pre-shocks, Snake?
PIPELINE => Could be a big one comin' any minute now...
PLISSKEN => Where's... Cuervo Jones...?
PIPELINE => Long gone. You'll never catch up with him now, Snake.
PLISSKEN => Where?
PIPELINE => Anaheim. Headquarters for everything. The whole town's gonna be there. Things changin' fast around here, Snake. It's not the same as the old days, man.
PLISSKEN => Take me there...
PIPELINE => You ain't doin' so good, Snake. You need help. (bends down, helps Plissken to his feet) You should talk to Hershe. She hates Cuervo. They used to be partners, but they split up.
PLISSKEN => Who?
PIPELINE => Hershe. She lives downtown with Mojo Dellasandro in the big boat. Down that way.
PIPELINE => She's connected with the Black Cowboys, and they don't take shit from nobody...
PIPELINE => Yo', man. It's a big one.
PIPELINE => Tsunami, Snake.
PIPELINE => Surf's up big time.
PIPELINE => Get ready, Snake. It's gonna be some kinda ride.
PIPELINE => Let the front edge pick you up. Don't get on your board till it peaks.
PIPELINE => Don't lose it, man. You slip off your board and it's the Big Wipeout, you know what I mean?
PIPELINE => Hang on, Snake!  YAAAAAAA!!!!
PIPELINE => Awesome, Snake. AWESOME, man!
PLISSKEN =>  See you later.
PLISSKEN => Listen up. I need directions. Downtown. Somebody named Hershe.
PLISSKEN => Later.
PLISSKEN => Cease fire with the bullshit.
CUERVO JONES => Abandon your firebases by 0500 hours. Have the news media standing by for my coronation. I'm arriving in style.
BRAZEN => He must be bouncing the signal from one of our communications satellites.
PRESIDENT => That means CableNet has already picked it up. This thing's going live all over the country.
CUERVO JONES =>  It's a brand new day comin' up this morning, and I'm just so proud to be leading the parade. See you soon, putos.
MALLOY => The prototype appears to be armed, Mr. President.  Shall I begin evacuation?
PRESIDENT => Does he know how to activate it?
MALLOY => Well, yeah. All you have to do is push the button.
BRAZEN => What about Plissken? He could still be -
PRESIDENT => Forget him. He's dead.
MALLOY => That may not be true, Mr. President.  He's one tough case. Plissken's been dead so many times I can't count. But he never stays down.
MALLOY => There are two choices, Mr. President. Wait for Plissken, or surrender. It's your decision.
SPINAL =>  Hershe - it's Snake Plissken.
PLISSKEN => I need a favor.
HERSHE => What's in it for me?
PLISSKEN => Wait a minute. I know that voice.  You're Carjack Malone.
HERSHE => Not anymore.
SPINAL => You two know each other?
PLISSKEN => You owe me. You left me holdin' everything back there in Cleveland.
SPINAL =>  Hershe, you were in Cleveland?
PLISSKEN => Yeah. With me and Texas Mike O'Shay.
HERSHE => I was called away on urgent business, Snake.
PLISSKEN => Don't lie to me.
HERSHE => All right, so I made another deal.
PLISSKEN => I got a new deal for you.
PLISSKEN => You help me, you live.
SPINAL => I wouldn't be doin' that, Snake.
HERSHE => We have a little arrangement. Anything happens to me, you're dead.
PLISSKEN => I'm already dead.
HERSHE =>  I see your point. What's the favor?
PLISSKEN =>  Get me to Cuervo Jones. Get me to the Kingdom. I got one hour.
HERSHE => Dream on, blue eye.
PLISSKEN => Say goodnight, Carjack.
HERSHE => Wait a minute. All right. Hold on.
SPINAL => Cuervo Jones has more firepower than two armies. No one gets near him.
HERSHE => Exactly what is this prototype? What does it do?
HERSHE => So whoever has it runs the show.
SPINAL => Only Cuervo's got it now.
PLISSKEN => How do you know all this?
HERSHE => So what's the deal, gorgeous?
PLISSKEN => We get the girl and the prototype. And we get out.
SPINAL => All of us?
PLISSKEN => Yeah.
PLISSKEN =>  We'll see.
HERSHE => Why should we leave? I love L.A. Where we gonna go? What's the payoff?
SPINAL => I'd like to get out but I don't have enough money.
PLISSKEN => The President's promised to give whoever helps me 1 million dollars.
SPINAL => Yeah? Greenbacks? I got ten million of them.
PLISSKEN => Uh-uh. Bluebacks.
PLISSKEN => Bluebacks. I'm not bullshittin'. I swear to God.
HERSHE => I don't know, sounds thin to me.
PLISSKEN => You want to stay here, while Cuervo Jones rules the world?
HERSHE =>  No, that sucks.  How are we getting out?
PLISSKEN => I don't know yet.
SPINAL => Shit.
HERSHE => You always were a loser, Plissken. Makin' things up as you go along. That's why I cut out on you in Cleveland. You're just a bum like the rest of us.
MOJO DELLASANDRO =>  Use the air.
MOJO DELLASANDRO => They're burning. Santa Anas. The night wind.
SPINAL => What're you talking about, Mojo?
MOJO DELLASANDRO => Death from above...
PLISSKEN => Don't like it, don't come.
SPINAL => Where'd you get these rigs, Carjack?
HERSHE => My name is Hershe Hernandez, do you understand, cowboy?
PLISSKEN => Yeah, kinda.
PLISSKEN => If he lets you get close enough.
HERSHE => The wind's up. Let's go.
HERSHE => See you in hell, Snake.
PLISSKEN => If I'm late, Carjack, don't start without me.
CUERVO JONES => They're simple people. They love a party.  We're gonna throw them one hell of a party when we get to America. Right?
CUERVO JONES => Put a smile on your face.
BIVOUAC => Cuervo Jones. Welcome, my Brother.
CUERVO JONES => Are you ready for the New World?
PLISSKEN => Is that what I think it is?
HERSHE => Snake. We need some kind of diversion.
CUERVO JONES => Would you please kill him for me?
BIVOUAC => My pleasure.
CUERVO JONES => You told me he was dead.
CUERVO JONES => Where?
CUERVO JONES =>  What?
CUERVO JONES => Where's Plissken?
CUERVO JONES => You're stalling, Eddie.  Talk, you little gringo!
CUERVO JONES => You've lied to me for the very last time.
PLISSKEN => She's overloaded! We're too heavy.
HERSHE =>  Somebody get off!
SPINAL =>  Who?
HERSHE => We're not gonna make it over the fuckin' mountain!
COM OFFICER => Aircraft leaving the island, sir. It's passed into restricted space, heading this way.
PRESIDENT => Is it Plissken?
COM OFFICER => Commander, I'm getting radio contact with the aircraft.
MALLOY => Boost it.
PLISSKEN => Get ready, shitheads. We're comin' in.
PRESIDENT => Thank God.
MALLOY =>  Plissken - this is Malloy. Do you have the prototype?
PLISSKEN =>  Yeah, I got it.
PLISSKE =>  Now give me the real one.
UTOPIA => Now we're even, Snake.
COM OFFICER => Commander Malloy - he's got lots of company.
MALLOY => Battle stations...
PLISSKEN => I think we've burned off enough fuel. We may be lighter enough to hover. Just barely.
HERSHE => Can you land?
PLISSKEN => No. The right skid's broken. If I try to set it down she'll crash. I have to stay in a hoverwhile you jump off. (beat as Plissken looks at Utopia) Hey, Carjack. We gotta hide the girl. Give her your dress.
HERSHE =>  My name is no longer Carjack. Will you please get that through your fucking head?
SPINAL => Holy shit.
PLISSKEN => Don't shoot! They can drag us down into the sea.
PLISSKEN =>  Take the controls!
UTOPIA => What do I do?
UTOPIA => Snake, look.
PRESIDENT => Where the hell is he going?
PLISSKEN => It's taking all the power we've got to hover.
PLISSKEN => Jump out. Head for the treeline and disappear.
PLISSKEN => Go!
PLISSKEN => All right, baby. Don't be too rough on me. We're gonna land.
PLISSKEN => Where's the anti-toxin...?
PRESIDENT => Give me the prototype.
MALLOY => Hold it, Plissken. Now give us the real one.
PLISSKEN => Give me the goddamn shot!
MALLOY => It was all a fake, Plissken.
BRAZEN => You were injected with glucose. There is no Plutoxin 7 virus. You were never going to die - at least not from anything we gave you.
MALLOY => C'mon, Snake - it's L.A. Everything's phony, you know that.
MALLOY => Relax, war hero. We took you for a ride, and you came through. Not bad for a dirtbag like you.
PRESIDENT => You're free, Plissken. But if you even so much as break wind on a country road I'll crush you like a bug.
COP => Commander...  Look what we found.
MALLOY => You didn't finish the mission, Plissken. We'll have to do that for you.
PLISSKEN => Got a smoke?
MALLOY => You're gonna have to learn to respect the law, Snake. The United States is a no- smoking nation. No smoking, no drinking, do drugs, no women unless you're married, no guns, no foul language. It's a brand new day for you, Snake.
PLISSKEN => The name's Plissken.
DUTY SERGEANT => We're being attacked, Commander. The north wall.
