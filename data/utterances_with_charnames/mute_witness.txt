ANDY => When I said more...
ANDY => ...I didn't mean trash the fucking set.
ANDY => This is not Chekhov. You're not the star. You're just another victim.
Natasha. => ANDY You get stabbed. You die.

NATASHA => Billy.
NATASHA => Madame Olga wants some sugar in her blood again. Billy laughs.

LYOSHA => Stop ! Stop ! Stop !
. Billy => is running upstairs. She enters the corridor, where she starts running, just when Lyosha appears in the staircase, running after Billy. When he reaches the landing, Lyosha switches on the lights in the corridor. Just before Lyosha enters the corridor, in the background, we see Billy hiding in a nook, a small partition, in the corridor.
LYOSHA => Hey !
LYOSHA => Hello ?
LYOSHA => Is anyone there ?

KAREN => Andy ! Andy ! CINEMA STUDIO - FILM SET - INTERIOR NIGHT
LYOSHA => Excuse me. It's true. We just fake murder. If we really want to murder...
LYOSHA => ...why make film of it ?
LYOSHA => We're not stupid, really. The janitor is trying to follow the conversation. We hear a policeman talking in Russian.
ARKADI => No, no. Sorry.
ARKADI => We understand how she feel. She think she see...
ARKADI => ...a real murder and panic. Billy taps on Karen's arm. Karen looks up at Arkadi.
FIRST POLICEMAN => Where did you see the murder from ?

KAREN => Wait. Stop ! Karen runs after Lyosha.
KAREN => He could expose the film.
FIRST POLICEMAN => Let her do it. Please.
KAREN => Okay.
KAREN => This lets you unload the film without needing a darkroom.
FIRST POLICEMAN => I see. Close shot on Arkadi's face. He looks very menacing.
ANDY => God, it's hot in here.
KAREN => If he had exposed the film to the light, he could have destroyed all the evidence.
KAREN => Actually, I haven't done this since film school.
KAREN => Right. It's safe in the can now.
KAREN => Here. Take it to the lab immediately...
KAREN => ...for developing.

ANDY => What ? What ?
FIRST POLICEMAN => Sweet. It is fake blood.

them. => ARKADI From lift shaft we take the rubbish here. Fast. Easy.
ANDY => Hey, we need that.
FIRST POLICEMAN => Sorry, I can do nothing for you now. But I will call you after I see the film. Okay ? Sorry. He walks away. The second policeman shakes hands with Arkadi and Lyosha and goes away with his chief.
ANDY => Well, I've never been more embarrassed in my entire life.
KAREN => I don't get it. I mean, Billy's a pro. She'd know the difference between a real murder and a gag.
ANDY => Please, has she even seen a real murder ?
KAREN => That's my point. If what she saw tonight was real, then she has seen the difference, right ?
ANDY => Oh, come on, honey. We all bought the guy cutting me up tonight. Even I believed it.
KAREN => Because you're a wuss.
She laughs. => ANDY I'm gonna let that slide.
ANDY => No offense, Billy, but I'd like to re-shoot the stuff today using that guy's knife.

ANDY => Could you pass me the salt, please ?
KAREN => You could at least make the effort. Andy stops eating, looks at Billy drinking water and then at Karen.
ANDY => Listen... I'm sorry. All I can think about now is the movie, but as soon as we get back, I promise, I'll learn.
KAREN => How often have I heard that ?
ANDY => Come on. I can understand some of what she's saying.
KAREN => What ?
ANDY => Okay, how about this ?
ANDY => Means makeup, right ?
KAREN => Wrong. It means somebody's look, the expression on their face.
ANDY => That was close.
KAREN => What Billy said she'll never forget the look on the girl's face tonight from the moment she knew she was gonna die. She said the pain and the terror was real. You can't act that.
THE REAPER => Come closer, Mr. Hausmann. I won't bite.
THE REAPER => Did it go smoothly ?
LYOSHA => About the money...
THE REAPER => Did it go smoothly ?
LYOSHA => Yes, of course. No problem.

ANDY => I don't care ? I don't care ? Fine, fine. I'm calling the American Embassy tonight, okay ?
KAREN => It's the weekend. They're closed.
ANDY => Not for us. My dad gave me the duty officer's direct number before we left, just in case. So say goodbye. He waves to Billy, who waves back to him. She blows a kiss to her sister, who blows one back, and enters her building.
LARSEN => Mr. Lovett, these are the two officers who answered the complaint. He shakes hands with the two policemen.
LOVETT => Good evening, gentlemen.
FIRST POLICEMAN => Good evening.
LARSEN => Please speak English to the ambassador's secretary. My chief asked me to meet Mr. Lovett here. If this witness is correct about what she saw tonight, she may help my own investigation.
LOVETT => Your English is quite good, Mr. Larsen.
LARSEN => Thank you. My mother was a translator.
LOVETT => In the university ?
LARSEN => No. KGB.
LARSEN => Please. They all follow the technician.
LARSEN => We've been tracking gangsters in Moscow running an international pornography and prostitution racket.
LARSEN => Sit down, please. We have information they have made snuff films here and sold them all over the world.
LOVETT => Snuff film... Is that what I think it is ?

LARSEN => What is the name of the witness ? What is it ?
FIRST POLICEMAN => Billy Hughes, sir.
LARSEN => Billy Hughes. Yes. She claims to have seen one being made.
LARSEN => The victims are illegal immigrants exploited as prostitutes by a gang headed by one man.
LARSEN => He is brutal, ruthless. They call him The Reaper.
LARSEN => I'm surprised his men gave up the film so easily. If it is what I think it is, our witness, Billy Hughes, is in great danger.

FIRST POLICEMAN => Have you seen a... how do you say... snuff film before ?
LARSEN => I saw a woman tied to a tree   kept alive while her arms and legs were cut off. It's hard   to talk about it, or even think about it. And it makes   you sick to watch it. You never forget the look in the   victim's eyes. The sheer panic and horror when they realize   they're about to die.

LARSEN => You know why we call him The Reaper ? You see his face, you die.
ANDY => Nice night, isn't it ?
ANDY => I'm just taking a piss. Right, you know, just... The watcher walks slowly down the ladder. Karen reaches the ladder, climbs on something we don't see, and catches the watcher's foot through the steps of the ladder. The man falls and rolls all the way down the ladder. He is unconscious and Andy ties his wrist to the ladder with the handcuff. Karen joins him. Andy seems very happy about the successful operation.
KAREN => Who the hell is that ?

ANDY => Billy ! Billy ! Billy !
KAREN => She's okay. She's fine.
ANDY => She's fine ? She's okay ? Billy mouth the words I'm fine and shows him the special effect device on her stomach. Larsen comes behind her and takes her by the shoulder, saying a few words in Russian. Billy says something in sign language to Karen.
KAREN => A cop ?
ANDY => A cop ?
KAREN => Oh, my God, I'm sorry.
ANDY => Sorry.
LARSEN => Forget it. Your sister was brilliant.
KAREN => Next time, hit back.
