Screenplay by => Peter Jackson, Fran Walsh and Philippa Boyens.
GANDALF => You cannot pass!
FRODO => Gandalf!
GANDALF => I am a servant of the Secret Fire, wielder of the Flame of Anor!
GANDALF => Argh! Go back to the shadow. The Dark Fire will not avail you, Flame of Udn! [Camera zooms in through the mountain and focuses on Gandalf and the Balrog on the bridge of Khazad-dm. The Balrog strikes down on Gandalf with its flaming sword. Gandalf parries the blow with Glamdring, shattering the Balrogs sword.] YOU SHALL NOT... PASS!!!
GANDALF => Argh!
BOROMIR => No! No!
FRODO => Gandalf!
GANDALF => Fly, you fools!
FRODO => Noooooooooooooooo!!!!
FRODO => [Calls after Gandalf as he falls into the abyss] Gaaandaaaaalf!!
FRODO => Gandalf!
SAM => What is it, Mr. Frodo?
FRODO => Nothing. Just a dream. [Lies back down.]
SAM => Mordor. The one place in Middle-earth we dont want to see any closer, and the one place were trying to get to. Its just where we cant get. Lets face it, Mr. Frodo, were lost. I dont think Gandalf meant for us to come this way.
FRODO => He didnt mean for a lot of things to happen, Sam... but they did.
SAM => Mr. Frodo? Its the Ring, isnt it?
FRODO => Its getting heavier. [Clutches the Ring by his chest and sits down, still panting. He then fumbles for his water bottle and takes a sip.]
FRODO => What food have we got left?
SAM => Well, let me see. [He takes out a package of lembas bread from his pack] Oh yes, lovely  Lembas bread. And look! [He digs deeper into his pack] More lembas bread.
SAM => I don't usually hold with foreign food, but this Elvish stuff, its not bad.
FRODO => [smiles] Nothing ever dampens your spirits, does it Sam?
SAM => Those rain clouds might.
SAM => [Looks around] This looks strangely familiar.
FRODO => [Exasperated] Its because weve been here before! Were going in circles.
SAM => Ah! What's that 'orrid stink? I'll warrant there's a nasty bog nearby. Can you smell it?
FRODO => Yes. I can smell it. [Drops to a whisper] Were not alone.
[NIGHTTIME => Frodo and Sam are sleeping. A dark shape appears on top of the cliff. The creature Gollum has appeared and is making his way down to the hobbits.]
GOLLUM => The thieves! The thieves! The filthy little thieves! Where is it? Where isss it? They stole it from us. My preciousss. [Gollum creeps closer and closer.] Curse them! We hates them! Its ours, it is... and we wantssss it!
FRODO => [menacingly] This is Sting. Youve seen it before, havent you... Gollum! Release him or Ill cut your throat!
GOLLUM => It burns! It burns us! It freezes! Nasty Elves twisted it. Take it off us!
SAM => Quiet you!
SAM => Its hopeless! Every Orc in Mordors going to hear this racket! Lets just tie him up and leave him.
GOLLUM => No! That would kill us! Kill us!
SAM => Its no more than you deserve!
FRODO => Maybe he does deserve to die, but now that I see him, I do pity him.
GOLLUM => [Begging] We be nice to them if they be nice to us. Take it off us. We swears to do what you wants. We swears.
FRODO => Theres no promise you can make that I can trust.
GOLLUM => We swears to serve the master of the preciousss. We swears on... on the precious. *Gollum. Gollum.*
FRODO => The Ring is treacherous. It will hold you to your word.
GOLLUM => Yes... on the preciousss. On the preciousss.
SAM => I dont believe you! [Gollum backs away, frightened, and climbs onto a boulder] Get down! I said, down!
FRODO => Sam!
SAM => Hes trying to trick us! We let him go hell throttle us in our sleep!
FRODO => You know the way to Mordor?
GOLLUM => [nods warily] Yes...
FRODO => Youve been there before?
GOLLUM => [nods again] Yes...
FRODO => You will lead us to the Black Gate.
PIPPIN => Merry. Merry! [He receives no response.]
UGLK => What is it? What do you smell?
MAN-FLESH URUK => [sniffs the air] Man-flesh.
PIPPIN => [quietly to himself] Aragorn!
UGLK => They've picked up our trail! Let's move!
ARAGORN => Their pace has quickened. [He looks up.] They must have caught our scent. Hurry! [He runs off.]
LEGOLAS => Come on, Gimli! [Looks back at Gimli and then runs after Aragorn]
GIMLI => [pauses in his steps and huffs] Three days and nights pursuit. No food. No rest. And no sign of our quarry but what bare rock can tell. [Runs after his companions.]
ARAGORN => Not idly do the leaves of Lrien fall.
LEGOLAS => [stops and turns to Aragorn.] They may yet be alive.
ARAGORN => Less than a day ahead of us. Come! [Runs off again]
LEGOLAS => Come, Gimli! We are gaining on them!
GIMLI => [Panting] I am wasted on cross-country! We dwarves are natural sprinters! Very dangerous over short distances!
ARAGORN => Rohan. Home of the horse-lords. There is something strange at work here. Some evil gives speed to these creatures, sets its will against us.
ARAGORN => Legolas, what do your Elf eyes see?
LEGOLAS => The Uruks turn northeast. Theyre taking the hobbits to Isengard!
ARAGORN => Saruman.
SARUMAN => The world is changing. [View changes to the tower of Barad-dr, with its huge Orc armies on a bridge.] Who now has the strength to stand against the armies of Isengard and Mordor? To stand against the might of Sauron and Saruman and the union of the two towers?
SARUMAN => Together, my lord Sauron, we shall rule this Middle-earth.
SARUMAN => The old world will burn in the fires of industry. The forests will fall. A new order will rise. We will drive the machine of war with the sword and the spear and the iron fists of the Orc. We have only to remove those who oppose us.
SARUMAN => The horsemen took your land. They drove your people into the hills to scratch a living off rocks.
DUNLAND MAN => Murderers!
SARUMAN => Take back the lands they stole from you! Burn every village!
CROWD => [Roars with approval] Argh!!
SARUMAN => It will begin in Rohan. Too long have these peasants stood against you. But no more.
MORWEN => othain! othain! You take your sister. Youll go faster with just two.
FREDA => [As Morwen puts her onto the horse in front of her brother] Papa says othain must not ride Garulf, he is too big for him!
MORWEN => Listen to me. You must ride to Edoras and raise the alarm. Do you understand me?
OTHAIN => Yes, Ma!
FREDA => [starts to cry] I dont wanna leave! I don't wanna go, Mama!
MORWEN => Freda, I will find you there.
MORWEN => Quickly!
MORWEN => [Looks after them] Go child!
SARUMAN => Rohan, my lord, is ready to fall.
OWYN => Thodred!
OWYN => Your son is badly wounded, my lord.
OMER => He was ambushed by Orcs. If we dont defend our country, Saruman will take it by force.
GRMA => That is a lie! [Appears from the shadows.] Saruman the White has ever been our friend and ally.
THODEN => [mumbles feebly] Grma Grma [Grma leans down close to the King.]My son...? Grma...?
OMER => Orcs are roaming freely across our lands. Unchecked. Unchallenged. Killing at will. Orcs bearing the white hand of Saruman. [He drops a helmet onto the ground, which topples over to reveal the white hand of Saruman.]
GRMA => Why do you lay these troubles on an already troubled mind. Can you not see? Your uncle is wearied by your malcontent, your war-mongering.
OMER => War-mongering?
OMER => How long is it since Saruman bought you? What was the promised price, Grma? When all the men are dead you will take your share of the treasure?
OMER => Too long have you watched my sister, too long have you haunted her steps.
GRMA => You see much omer, Son of omund. Too much. [The thugs punch omer n the stomach] You are banished forthwith from the kingdom of Rohan. Under pain of death!
OMER => [Being dragged away] Argh!!
GIMLI => Keep breathing! Thats the key! Breathe! Ho!
LEGOLAS => Theyve run as if the very whips of their masters were behind them.
MORDOR ORC => Were not going no further till weve had a breather!
UGLK => Get a fire going!
PIPPIN => Merry! Merry!
MERRY => [opens his eyes] I think... we might have made a mistake leaving the Shire, Pippin.
PIPPIN => Whats making that noise?
MERRY => [looks towards the forest] Its the trees.
PIPPIN => What?
MERRY => Do you remember the Old Forest? On the borders of Buckland? Folk used to say that there was something in the water that made the trees grow tall... and come alive.
PIPPIN => Alive?
MERRY => Trees that could whisper. Talk to each other. Even move.
MAHUR => I'm starving. We ain't 'ad nothin' but maggoty bread for three stinkin' days!
SNAGA => Yeah. Why cant we have some meat? [His eyes rest on the hobbits.] What about them? Theyre fresh.
UGLK => They are not for eating!
GRISHNKH => What about their legs? They don't need those. Ooh They look tasty!
UGLK => [Shoves at the Orcs] Get back, scum!
MORDOR ORC => Carve them up!
SNAGA => [Moves towards the hobbits with his blade drawn] Just a mouth full.
UGLK => No!
UGLK => Looks like meats back on the menu, boys!!
MERRY => Pippin, lets go.
GRISHNKH => [Brandishing a blade in front of Pippins face] Go on, call for help. Squeal! No ones gonna save you now!
MERRY => Pippin! [Gestures for them to make their escape.]
PIPPIN => ARGH!!!
LEGOLAS => [Pauses and looks up] A red sun rises. Blood has been spilled this night.
ARAGORN => Riders of Rohan, what news from the Mark?
OMER => What business does an Elf, a man and a Dwarf have in the Riddermark? Speak quickly!
GIMLI => Give me your name, Horsemaster, and I shall give you mine.
OMER => I would cut off your head, Dwarf, if it stood but a little higher from the ground.
LEGOLAS => You would die before your stroke fell!
ARAGORN => I am Aragorn, son of Arathorn. This is Gimli, son of Glin and Legolas of the Woodland realm. We are friends of Rohan and of Thoden, your king.
OMER => Thoden no longer recognizes friend from foe. [Takes off helmet] Not even his own kin.
OMER => Saruman has poisoned the mind of the king and claimed lordship over these lands. My company are those loyal to Rohan. And for that, we are banished. The White Wizard is cunning. He walks here and there, they say, as an old man, hooded and cloaked. And everywhere his spies slip past our nets.
ARAGORN => We are not spies. We track a party of Uruk-hai westward across the plain. Theyve taken two of our friends captive.
OMER => The Uruks are destroyed. We slaughtered them during the night.
GIMLI => But there were two hobbits. Did you see two hobbits with them?
ARAGORN => They would be small  only children to your eyes.
OMER => We left none alive. We piled the carcasses and burned them. [Points to a smoking pile in the distance.]
GIMLI => Dead?
OMER => [nods] I am sorry.
OMER => Hasufel! Arod! [Two horses move up.] May these horses bear you to better fortune than their former masters. Farewell.
OMER => Look for your friends. But do not trust to hope, it has forsaken these lands. [To the riders] We ride north!
GIMLI => Its one of their wee belts.
LEGOLAS => [with his head bowed and eyes closed] Hiro th ab 'wanath... (May they find peace in death)
ARAGORN => [Kicks a helmet and yells] AAARRGGHH!!! [He falls to his knees.]
GIMLI => We failed them.
ARAGORN => A hobbit lay here, and the other. [Flashback: Pippin yells as he looks up at a pair of thrashing hooves bearing down on him. He rolls over, avoiding the hooves.] They crawled.
ARAGORN => Their hands were bound. [Flashback: Merry rubs his bonds furiously against the sharp edge of a weapon.] Their bonds were cut. [Aragorn holds up a broken length of thick rope.]
ARAGORN => They ran over here. They were followed.
[FLASHBACK => Their hands freed, the hobbits run away from the battle scene, dodging under a horse and trying to stay out of harms way. As they flee, Grishnkh grabs Pippin by his belt and clings on.]
MERRY => The belt!
MERRY => Run!
ARAGORN => The tracks lead away from the battle... [They break into a run and then stop] into Fangorn Forest.
GIMLI => Fangorn. What madness drove them in there?
PIPPIN => Did we lose him? [Looks around] I think we lost him.
GRISHNKH => Im gonna rip out your filthy little innards! Come here!
MERRY => Trees! Climb a tree!
MERRY => [Looks around and then sighs in relief.] He's gone.
PIPPIN => Merry!
TREEBEARD => Hooooo...
PIPPIN => Argh!!
GRISHNKH => Lets put a maggot-hole in your belly. [Suddenly he senses something behind him and as he looks up, the tree stomps and squashes him onto the forest floor.]
PIPPIN => Run, Merry!
TREEBEARD => [Looks at the creatures in his hands] Little Orcs! Burrum...
PIPPIN => Its talking, Merry. The tree is talking!
TREEBEARD => Tree?! I am no tree. I am an Ent. [Stomps slowly through the forest.]
MERRY => A treeherder! A shepherd of the forest.
PIPPIN => Dont talk to it, Merry. Dont encourage it.
TREEBEARD => Treebeard, some call me.
PIPPIN => And whose side are you on?
TREEBEARD => Side? I am on nobodys side because nobodys on my side, little Orc. Nobody cares for the woods anymore.
MERRY => Were not Orcs. Were Hobbits!
TREEBEARD => Hobbits? Never heard of a hobbit before. Sounds like Orc mischief to me! [Tightens his hold on the hobbits and squeezes them. Merry and Pippin whimpers in pain] They come with fire, they come with axes. Gnawing, biting, breaking, hacking, burning! Destroyers and usurpers, curse them!
MERRY => No, you dont understand. Were Hobbits... Halflings! Shirefolk!
TREEBEARD => Maybe you are and maybe you arent. The White Wizard will know.
PIPPIN => The White Wizard?
MERRY => Saruman.
GOLLUM => See, see, we have led you out! Hurry hobbitses hurry. Very lucky we find you.
GOLLUM => Nice hobbit. [Leaps after Frodo, putting a wide berth between him and Sam.]
SAM => Whoa, its a bog! Hes led us into a swamp!
GOLLUM => A swamp, yes, yes. Come, master. We will take you on safe paths through the mist. Come, hobbits, come. We go quickly.
GOLLUM => I found it, I did. The way through the marshes. Orcs don't use it. Orcs don't know it. They go round for miles and miles. Come quickly. Swift and quick as shadows we must be.
SAM => There are dead things! Dead faces in the water!
GOLLUM => All dead. All rotten. Elves and men and orcses. A great battle long ago. [Turns to face the hobbits.] The Dead Marshes. Yes, yes that is their name. This way. Dont follow the lights.
SAM => Ohh!
GOLLUM => Careful now, or hobbits go down to join the dead ones and light little candles of their own.
SAM => Frodo!
FRODO => [Looks at Gollum in perplexed gratitude and disbelief.] Gollum...
GOLLUM => Dont follow the lights! [Crawls away]
SAM => [Runs to Frodos side.] Mr. Frodo! Are you alright?
[NIGHTFALL => Sam is asleep but Frodo is still awake. He is holding the Ring in the palm of his hand and stroking it, mesmerized. Suddenly he hears Gollum.]
GOLLUM => Sooo bright. Sooo beautiful. [Frodo quickly puts the Ring back inside his shirt. He looks up to see Gollum crouching away from him, stroking the centre of his palm] our preciousss...
FRODO => What did you say?
GOLLUM => Master should be resting. Master needs to keep up his strength.
FRODO => [Moves over and crouches in front of Gollum] Who are you?
GOLLUM => Mustnt ask us. Not its business. *Gollum, Gollum*
FRODO => Gandalf told me you were one of the River Folk.
GOLLUM => Cold be heart and hand and bone. Cold be travellers far from home.
FRODO => He said your life was a sad story.
GOLLUM => They do not see what lies ahead, when sun has failed and moon is dead.
FRODO => You were not so very different from a hobbit once, were you... Smagol?
GOLLUM => [Looks up slowly.] What did you call me?
FRODO => That was your name once, wasnt it? A long time ago.
GOLLUM => My name... My name... S... S...Smagol
GOLLUM => Argh!!
SAM => Black Riders!
GOLLUM => Hide! Hide!
FRODO => Argh!
FRODO => Argh!!
SAM => Cmon Frodo! C'mon!
GOLLUM => Quick! They will see us! They will see us!
SAM => I thought they were dead!
GOLLUM => Dead? No, you cannot kill them. No.
GOLLUM => [cowering] Wraiths! Wraiths on wings! They are calling for it. They are calling for the preciousss.
SAM => Mr. Frodo! Its alright. Im here.
GOLLUM => Hurry, hobbits. The Black Gate is very close.
GIMLI => [Spits] Ptui! Orc blood.
ARAGORN => These are strange tracks.
GIMLI => The air is so close in here.
LEGOLAS => This forest is old. Very old. Full of memory... and anger.
LEGOLAS => The trees are speaking to each other.
ARAGORN => [Whispers] Gimli!
GIMLI => Huh?
ARAGORN => [Gestures] Lower your axe.
GIMLI => [Lowering his axe slowly] Oh.
LEGOLAS => Aragorn, nad n ennas! (Something is out there.)
ARAGORN => Man cenich?
LEGOLAS => The White Wizard approaches.
ARAGORN => Do not let him speak. He will put a spell on us.
ARAGORN => We must be quick.
WHITE WIZARD => You are tracking the footsteps of two young hobbits.
ARAGORN => Where are they?
WHITE WIZARD => They passed this way the day before yesterday. They met someone they did not expect. Does that comfort you?
ARAGORN => Who are you? Show yourself!
ARAGORN => It cannot be. You fell.
GANDALF => Through fire and water. [Flashback: Gandalf is battling the Balrog atop Drins Tower.] From the lowest dungeon to the highest peak, I fought with the Balrog of Morgoth.
GANDALF => Until at last, I threw down my enemy and smote his ruin upon the mountainside.
GANDALF => Darkness took me. And I strayed out of thought and time. [Camera zooms in Gandalfs eye and enters an amorphous realm of stars and galaxies, ending in a blinding white light] Stars wheeled overhead and everyday was as long as a life-age of the earth. But it was not the end. I felt life in me again.
GANDALF => I've been sent back until my task is done.
ARAGORN => Gandalf!
GANDALF => Gandalf? Yes... That's what they used to call me. Gandalf the Grey. That was my name. [He smiles]
GIMLI => Gandalf!
GANDALF => [With a twinkle in his eye] I am Gandalf the White. [Aragorn grins] And I come back to you now at the turn of the tide.
GANDALF => One stage of your journey is over, another begins. War has come to Rohan. We must ride to Edoras with all speed.
LEGOLAS => That is one of the Mearas, unless my eyes are cheated by some spell.
GANDALF => Shadowfax. [Gimli bows in the background.] He's the lord of all horses and he's been my friend through many dangers.
TREEBEARD => My home lies deep in the forest near the roots of the mountain. I told Gandalf I would keep you safe and safe is where Ill keep you. The trees have grown wild and dangerous. Anger festers in their hearts. They will harm you if they can. There are too few of us now. Too few of us Ents left to manage them.
GOLLUM => The Black Gate of Mordor.
SAM => Oh save us. My ol' Gaffer'd have a thing or two to say if he could see us now.
GOLLUM => Master says to show him the way into Mordor, so good Smagol does. Master says so.
FRODO => I did.
SAM => Thats it then. We cannot get past that.
SAM => Look! The gate, it's opening! I can see a way down.
FRODO => Sam, no!
SAM => Argh!!
GOLLUM => Master!
FRODO => I do not ask you to come with me, Sam.
SAM => I know, Mr Frodo. I doubt even these Elvish cloaks will hide us in there.
FRODO => Now!
GOLLUM => No! No, no master! They catch you! They catch you! Dont take it to him! He wants the preciousss. Always hes looking for it! And the preciousss is wanting to go back to him. But we mustnt let him have it.
GOLLUM => No! [Pulls Frodo back again.] Theres another way. More secret. A dark way.
SAM => Why havent you spoken of this before?!
GOLLUM => Because Master did not ask!
SAM => Hes up to something.
FRODO => Are you saying theres another way into Mordor?
GOLLUM => Yes. There is a path, and some stairs, and then a tunnel. [Frodo and Sam watch as the Black Gate closes. Gollum is stroking Frodos arm and burying his face in his cloak.]
FRODO => Hes led us this far, Sam.
SAM => Mr. Frodo, no.
FRODO => Hes been true to his word.
SAM => [Whispers] No!
FRODO => Lead the way, Smagol.
GOLLUM => Good Smagol always helps.
GANDALF => Edoras and the Golden Hall of Meduseld. There dwells Thoden, King of Rohan, whose mind is overthrown. Sarumans hold over King Thoden is now very strong.
OWYN => My lord, your son, he is dead. My lord? Uncle?
OWYN => Will you not go to him? [She weeps.] Will you do nothing?
GANDALF => Be careful what you say. Do not look for welcome here.
GRMA => Oh, he he must have died sometime in the night. What a tragedy for the king to lose his only son and heir.
GRMA => I understand his passing is hard to accept, especially now that your brother has deserted you.
OWYN => [jumps back and throws off Grmas hand] Leave me alone, snake!
GRMA => [Rises from the bed and moves ever closer to owyn] Oh, but you are alone! Who knows what you have spoken to the darkness. In bitter watches of the night, when all your life seems to shrink, the walls of your bower closing in about you, like a hutch to trammel some wild thing in.
GRMA => So fair, so cold, like a morning of pale spring still clinging to winter's chill.
OWYN => Your words are poison!
GIMLI => Youll find more cheer in a graveyard.
GANDALF => [sees Hma] Ah.
HMA => I cannot allow you before Thoden-King so armed, Gandalf Greyhame. By order of Grma Wormtongue.
HMA => [gestures to Gandalf] Your staff.
GANDALF => Hmm? [Glances at his staff.] Oh. You would not part an old man from his walking stick? [Looks at Hma innocently.]
GRMA => [Leaning down and whispering to Thoden.] My lord, Gandalf the Grey is coming. Hes a herald of woe.
GANDALF => The courtesy of your hall is somewhat lessened of late, Thoden King.
GRMA => [Whispering to Thoden.] Hes not welcome.
THODEN => Why should I welcome you, Gandalf Stormcrow? [Looks to Grma for affirmation.]
GRMA => A just question, my liege. [He walks towards Gandalf.] Late is the hour in which this conjurer chooses to appear. Lathspell spell I name him. Ill news is an ill guest.
GANDALF => Be silent! Keep your forked tongue behind you teeth. I have not passed through fire and death to bandy crooked words with a witless worm! [Raises his staff against Grma.]
GRMA => His staff! [Backing away from Gandalf while addressing the guards] I told you to take the wizards staff!
GANDALF => Thoden, son of Thengel, too long have you sat in the shadows.
GIMLI => [Growls] I would stay still, if I were you.
GANDALF => Hearken to me! I release you from the spell. [Gestures with his hand]
THODEN => [Menacingly] Hahahhhahahahah! [Gandalf opens his eyes in surprise.] You have no power here, Gandalf the Grey!
THODEN => Argh!
GANDALF => [Points his staff towards Thoden.] I will draw you, Saruman, as poison is drawn from a wound.
ARAGORN => Wait.
THODEN => [In Sarumans voice.] If I go. . . Thoden dies.
GANDALF => You did not kill me, you will not kill him!
THODEN => [in Saruman's voice] Rohan is mine!
GANDALF => Be gone!!
THODEN => [Looks closely at owyn] I know your face. owyn owyn.
THODEN => Gandalf?
GANDALF => Breathe the free air again, my friend.
THODEN => [Standing up and looking around him.] Dark have been my dreams of late. [He looks down at his trembling hands.]
GANDALF => Your fingers would remember their old strength better... if they grasped your sword.
GRMA => Argh! [Beseechingly to Thoden] I've only ever served you, my lord!
THODEN => [Advancing towards Grma, holding the sword firmly in his hand] Your leechcraft would have had me crawling on all fours like a beast!
GRMA => [Grovelling] Send me not from your side.
ARAGORN => No, my lord! No, my lord. Let him go. Enough blood has been spilled on his account.
GRMA => Get out of my way!
HMA => Hail, Thoden king!
THODEN => Where is Thodred? Where is my son?
THODEN => Simbelmyn. Ever has it grown on the tombs of my forebearers. [Looks at Gandalf] Now it shall cover the grave of my son. Alas, that these evil days should be mine. The young perish and the old linger. That I should live to see the last days of my house.
GANDALF => Thodreds death was not of your making.
THODEN => No parent should have to bury their child.
GANDALF => He was strong in life. His spirit will find its way to the halls of your fathers. Westu hl. Feru, Thodred, Feru. (Be-thou well. Go-thou, Thodred, go-thou.)
OWYN => They had no warning. They were unarmed. Now the wildmen are moving through the Westfold, burning as they go. Rick, cot and tree.
FREDA => Wheres mama?
OWYN => Shh...
GANDALF => This is but a taste of the terror that Saruman will unleash. All the more potent for he is driven now by fear of Sauron. Ride out and meet him head on. Draw him away from your women and children. [Leans forward and puts a hand on Thodens chair. Thoden looks at his hand warily.] You must fight.
ARAGORN => You have two thousand good men riding north as we speak. omer is loyal to you. His men will return and fight for their king.
THODEN => They will be three hundred leagues from here by now. omer cannot help us. I know what it is that you want of me. But I will not bring further death to my people. I will not risk open war.
ARAGORN => Open war is upon you. Whether you would risk it or not.
THODEN => When last I looked, Thoden, not Aragorn, was king of Rohan.
GANDALF => Then what is the kings decision?
HMA => By order of the king, the city must empty. We make for the refuge of Helms Deep. Do not burden yourselves with treasures. Take only what provisions you need.
GIMLI => Helms Deep! They flee to the mountains when they should stand and fight. Who will defend them if not their king.
ARAGORN => Hes only doing what he thinks is best for his people. Helms Deep has saved them in the past.
GANDALF => There is no way out of that ravine. Thoden is walking into a trap. He thinks hes leading them to safety. What they will get is a massacre. Thoden has a strong will but I fear for him. I fear for the survival of Rohan. He will need you before the end, Aragorn. The people of Rohan will need you. The defences HAVE to hold.
ARAGORN => They will hold.
GANDALF => [Turns to Shadowfax and strokes him] The Grey Pilgrim... thats what they used to call me. Three hundred lives of men Ive walked this earth and now I have no time. With luck, my search will not be in vain. Look to my coming at first light on the fifth day. At dawn, look to the East.
ARAGORN => [Opens the stall gates] Go.
ARAGORN => You have some skill with a blade.
OWYN => [Stepping back and sheathing her sword.] Women of this country learned long ago: Those without swords may still die upon them. I fear neither death nor pain.
ARAGORN => What do you fear, my lady?
OWYN => A cage. To stay behind bars until use and old age accept them and all chance of valor has gone beyond recall or desire.
ARAGORN => You are a daughter of kings, a shieldmaiden of Rohan. [He sheaths his knife.] I do not think that would be your fate.
GRMA => Thoden will not stay at Edoras. Its vulnerable, he knows this. He will expect an attack on the city. They will flee to Helms Deep, the great fortress of Rohan. It is a dangerous road to take through the mountains. They will be slow. They will have women and children with them.
SARUMAN => Send out your warg riders.
SAM => Hey Stinker! Dont go getting too far ahead!
FRODO => Why do you do that?
SAM => What?
FRODO => Call him names; run him down all the time.
SAM => Because because that's what he is, Mr. Frodo. There's naught left in 'im but lies and deceit. It's the Ring he wants. It's all he cares about.
FRODO => [Glaring at Sam] You have no idea what it did to him. What its still doing to him. [He walks past Sam and stops.] I want to help him, Sam...
SAM => Why?
FRODO => Because I have to believe he can come back.
SAM => You cant save him, Mr. Frodo.
FRODO => [Snapping at Sam]What do you know about it? Nothing!
FRODO => [With remorse] I'm sorry, Sam. I don't know why I said that.
SAM => [Looks back at Frodo with tears in his eyes.] I do. It's the Ring. You can't take your eyes off it. I've seen you. You're not eating. You barely sleep. It's taken a hold of you, Mr Frodo. You have to fight it!
FRODO => [Grows angry again] I know what I have to do Sam. The Ring was entrusted to me! It's my task! Mine! My own! [He walks away]
SAM => Cant you hear yourself? Dont you know who you sound like?
GOLLUM => We wants it. We needs it. Must have the precioussss. They stole it from us. Sneaky little hobbitsesss. Wicked, trickssssy, falssse!
SMAGOL => No! Not Master.
GOLLUM => Yes, precious. False. They will cheat you, hurt you, lie.
SMAGOL => Masters my friend.
GOLLUM => [Tauntingly] You dont have any friends. Nobody likes YOU...
SMAGOL => [Covers his ears] Not listening. Im not listening.
GOLLUM => Youre a liar and a thief.
SMAGOL => [Shaking his head] Nope.
GOLLUM => Murderer!
SMAGOL => [Starts to weep and whimper] Go away.
GOLLUM => Go away! [Cackles] HAHAHAHA!!
SMAGOL => [Weeping and in a small voice] I hate you. I hate you!
GOLLUM => [Fiercely] Where would you be without me? *Gollum, gollum*. I saved us. It was me. We survived because of me!
SMAGOL => [Resolute] Not anymore.
GOLLUM => [Startled] What did you say?
SMAGOL => Master looks after us now. We dont need you.
GOLLUM => What?
SMAGOL => Leave now and never come back.
GOLLUM => No!!
SMAGOL => [Louder] Leave now and never come back!
GOLLUM => [Growls and bares his teeth] Arrrgh!!!
SMAGOL => LEAVE. NOW. AND. NEVER. COME. BACK!
SMAGOL => We... we told him to go away! And away he goes, preciousss. [He hops around in joy and does a little dance.] Gone, gone, gone! Smagol is free!
SMAGOL => Look! Look! See what Smagol finds! Hehehe! Hahaha!
SMAGOL => They are young. They are tender. They are nice. Yes they are! Eat them! Eat them!
SAM => Youll make him sick, you will, behaving like that! [Holding up the two rabbits] Theres only one way to eat a brace of coneys.
SMAGOL => [Looking into the pot] Argh!! Whats it doing! Stupid fat hobbit! It ruins it!
SAM => Whats to ruin? Theres hardly any meat on em.
SAM => What we need is a few good taters.
GOLLUM => Whats taters, preciousss? Whats taters uh?
SAM => PO-TAY-TOES! Boil em. Mash em. Stick em in a stew. Lovely big golden chips with a nice piece of fried fish....
SMAGOL => [Sticks out his tongue in disgust] Pbbbttt!!
SAM => Even you couldnt say no to that. [He takes a sip of the stew]
SMAGOL => Oh yes we could! Spoil nice fish... [scrambles up close to Sam] Give it to usss rrraw... and wrrriggling! [Makes sickeningly happy face.] You keep nasty chips. [Hops away]
SAM => Youre hopeless.
SAM => Mr. Frodo?
SAM => Who are they?
GOLLUM => Wicked men. Servants of Sauron. They are called to Mordor. The Dark One is gathering all armies to him. It wont be long now. He will soon be ready.
SAM => Ready to do what?
GOLLUM => To make his war. The last war that will cover all the world in shadow.
FRODO => Weve got to get moving. Come on, Sam.
SAM => [Suddenly grabs Frodos arm] Mr Frodo! Look! Its an Oliphaunt!
SAM => No one at home will believe this...
FRODO => [Looking around] Smagol?
FRODO => Weve lingered here too long. Come on, Sam!
SAM => Ah!
FARAMIR => Bind their hands.
GIMLI => Its true you dont see many Dwarf women. And in fact, they are so alike in voice and appearance, haha that theyre often mistaken for Dwarf men.
ARAGORN => [Gestures and whispers] Its the beards....
GIMLI => And this, in turn, has given rise to the belief that there are no Dwarf women. And that dwarves just spring out of holes in the ground!
OWYN => [Laughs gaily] Hahahaha!!
GIMLI => Hehehe! Which is of course ridiculous Whoa!!
OWYN => Ooh! [She rushes forward to Gimli]
GIMLI => [Struggling to get up] Its alright, its alright. Nobody panic. That was deliberate. It was deliberate.
ARWEN => The light of the Evenstar does not wax and wane It is mine to give to whom I will... Like my heart Go to sleep...
[FLASHBACK => Aragorn is lying on a chaise in Rivendell. He opens his eyes and sees Arwen before him, smiling down at him.]
ARAGORN => I am asleep. This is a dream.
ARWEN => [Bends down to kiss him] Then it is a good dream. Sleep
ARAGORN => Min l pennich nin i aur hen telitha. (You told me once that this day would come.)
ARWEN => [Turns to look at Aragorn]  i vethed... n i onnad. Boe bedich go Frodo. Han bd ln. (This is not the end... it is the beginning. You must go with Frodo. That is your path.)
ARAGORN => [Walks over to Arwen] Dolen i vd o nin.
ARWEN => Si peliannen i vd na dail ln. Si boe -dhannathach. (It is already laid before your feet. You cannot falter now.)
ARAGORN => Arwen
ARWEN => Ae -esteliach nad... estelio han. Estelio ammen. (If you trust nothing else... trust this. Trust us.)
OWYN => Where is she? The woman who gave you that jewel.
ELROND => Our time here is ending. Arwens time is ending. Let her go. Let her take the ship into the west. Let her bear away her love for you to the Undying Lands. There it will be evergreen.
ARAGORN => But never more than a memory.
ELROND => I will not leave my daughter here to die.
ARAGORN => She stays because she still has hope.
ELROND => She stays for YOU! She belongs with her people!
ARAGORN => Idhren emmen menna gui ethwel. Hae o auth a nr a naeth. (You have a chance for another life. Away from war... grief... despair.)
ARWEN => Why are you saying this?
ARAGORN => I am mortal; you are Elfkind. It was a dream, Arwen, nothing more.
ARAGORN => This belongs to you.
ARWEN => [Closes Aragorns hand over the Evenstar] It was a gift. Keep it.
OWYN => My lord?
ARAGORN => She is sailing to the Undying Lands, with all that is left of her kin.
GAMLING => What is it? Hma?
HMA => [Looking around] Im not sure.
GAMLING => Wargs!
LEGOLAS => Argh! [Shouts to Aragorn] A scout!
THODEN => What is it? What do you see?
ARAGORN => [Running back to Thoden] Wargs! We are under attack!
ARAGORN => Get them out of here!
THODEN => All riders to the head of the column!
GIMLI => [Trying to mount Arod] Come on, get me up here, Im a rider! Argh!
THODEN => [To owyn] You must lead the people to Helms Deep. And make haste!
OWYN => I can fight!
THODEN => No! You must do this... for me.
THODEN => [To his men] Follow me! Yah!
GIMLI => [Tries to get Arod to move] Forward. I mean, charge forward! March forward! [Arod moves off with Gimli seated rather unsteadily.] Thats it! Go on!
OWYN => [To the villagers] Make for the lower ground! Stick together!
WARG-RIDERS => Argh!!
THODEN => CHARGE!!
GIMLI => Bring your pretty face to my axe!
GIMLI => [Jumping back as the warg falls, outraged] Argh! That one counts as mine!
GIMLI => Argh! Stinking creature. Argh!
GIMLI => [Eyes widening] Ooh..!
GIMLI => [As the warg lands on him] Oooh!!
LEGOLAS => [Looking around] Aragorn!
GIMLI => Aragorn?
GIMLI => [Standing over the dying Orc] Tell me what happened and I will ease your passing.
SHARKU => Hes [cough] dead. [Laughs evilly] Took a little tumble off the cliff.
LEGOLAS => [Looks towards the edge of the cliff, and grabs Sharku] You lie!
THODEN => [To his men] Get the wounded on horses. The wolves of Isengard will return. Leave the dead.
THODEN => [Puts a hand on Legolas' shoulder] Come.
REFUGEES => Helms Deep! At last! There it is!
OLD WOMAN => [To owyn] Were safe, my lady! Thank you!
FREDA => Mama!
MORWEN => othain! Freda!
GAMLING => Make way for Thoden!
SOLDIERS => Sire!
GAMLING => Make way for the king!
OWYN => [Looking about] So few. So few of you have returned.
THODEN => [Dismounting] Our people are safe. We have paid for it with many lives.
GIMLI => [Going up to owyn] My lady...
OWYN => Lord Aragorn, where is he?
GIMLI => He fell...
THODEN => Draw all our forces behind the wall. Bar the gate, and set a watch on the surround.
GAMLING => What of those who cannot fight, my lord? The women and children?
THODEN => Get them into the caves. [Walks down the steps and past a sewer gate] Saruman's arm would have grown long indeed if he thinks he can reach us here.
GRMA => Helms Deep has one weakness. Its outer wall is solid rock but for a small culvert at its base which is little more than a drain.
GRMA => How? How can fire undo stone? What kind of device could bring down the wall?
SARUMAN => If the wall is breached, Helm's Deep will fall.
GRMA => [Following Saruman] Even if it is breached, it would take a number beyond reckoning, thousands to storm the keep.
SARUMAN => Tens of thousands.
GRMA => But, my lord, there is no such force.
SARUMAN => A new power is rising. Its victory is at hand!
SARUMAN => This night, the land will be stained with the blood of Rohan! March to Helms Deep! Leave none alive!
SARUMAN => To war!!
SARUMAN => [Sneers] There will be no dawn for Men.
PIPPIN => Look! Theres smoke to the south!
TREEBEARD => There is always smoke rising from Isengard these days.
MERRY => Isengard?
TREEBEARD => There was a time when Saruman would walk in my woods. But now he has a mind of metal and wheels. He no longer cares for growing things.
PIPPIN => What is it?
MERRY => Its Sarumans army! The war has started.
ARWEN => [Kissing him on the lips] May the grace of the Valar protect you.
ARAGORN => [Mumbles] Brego [He grabs hold of Bregos mane, pulls himself onto the horse and rides slowly to Helms Deep.]
ELROND => [Coming into her room] Arwen.
ELROND => Tollen i l. I chair gwannar na Valannor. Si bado, no crar. (Arwen, it is time. The ships are leaving for Valinor. Go now... before it is too late.)
ARWEN => I have made my choice.
ELROND => He is not coming back. Why do you linger here when there is no hope?
ARWEN => There is still hope.
ELROND => [Walks towards window and looks out] If Aragorn survives this war, you will still be parted. If Sauron is defeated, and Aragorn made king and all that you hope for comes true, you will still have to taste the bitterness of mortality. Whether by the sword or the slow decay of time, Aragorn will die.
ELROND => And there will be no comfort for you. No comfort to ease the pain of his passing. He will come to death, an image of the splendor of the kings of men in glory undimmed before the breaking of the world.
ELROND => But you, my daughter, you will linger on in darkness and in doubt. As nightfall in winter that comes without a star. Here you will dwell, bound to your grief, under the fading trees, until all the world is changed and the long years of your life are utterly spent.
ELROND => [Tuning to Arwen] Arwen... there is nothing for you here, only death.
ELROND => A im, -'erin veleth ln? (Do I not also have your love?)
ARWEN => [Crying and moving into her fathers embrace] Gerich meleth nn, ada. (You have my love, father)
GALADRIEL => I amar prestar aen... han mathon ne nen, han mathon ne chae a han nostan ned gwilith. (The world has changed... I feel it in the water, I feel it in the earth, I smell it in the air.) The power of the enemy is growing. [Saruman is communicating with Sauron via the Palantr.] Sauron will use his puppet Saruman to destroy the people of Rohan. Isengard has been unleashed. [View of Saruman's marching army] The eye of Sauron now turns to Gondor, the last free kingdom of men. [View of Osgiliath] His war on this country will come swiftly. He senses the Ring is close. The strength of the Ringbearer is failing. In his heart, Frodo begins to understand. [Close-up of Galadriel] The quest will claim his life. You know this. You have foreseen it. It is the risk we all took.
GALADRIEL => In the gathering dark, the will of the Ring grows strong. It works hard now to find its way back into the hands of men.
GALADRIEL => Men, who are so easily seduced by its power. The young captain of Gondor has but to extend his hands, take the Ring for his own and the world will fall. It is close now, so close to achieving its goal.
GALADRIEL => For Sauron will have dominion of all life on this Earth, even unto the ending of the world. The time of the Elves is over.
GALADRIEL => Do we leave Middle-earth to its fate? Do we let them stand alone?
FARAMIR => What news?
MADRIL => Our scouts report Saruman has attacked Rohan. Thodens people have fled to Helms Deep. [Points at the map] But we must look to our own borders. Faramir, Orcs are on the move. Sauron is marshalling an army. Easterlings and Southrons are passing through the Black Gate.
FARAMIR => How many?
MADRIL => Some thousands. More come every day.
FARAMIR => Whos covering the river to the north?
MADRIL => We pulled 500 men at Osgiliath, but if the city is attacked, we wont hold it.
FARAMIR => [Tracing on the map] Saruman attacks from Isengard. Sauron from Mordor. The fight will come to men on both fronts. Gondor is weak. Sauron will strike us soon. And he will strike hard. He knows now we do not have the strength to repel him.
FARAMIR => My men tell me that you are Orc spies.
SAM => Spies?! Now wait just a minute!
FARAMIR => Well if youre not spies, then who are you?
FARAMIR => Speak.
FRODO => We are hobbits of the Shire. Frodo Baggins is my name and this is Samwise Gamgee.
FARAMIR => Your bodyguard?
SAM => His gardener.
FARAMIR => And where is your skulking friend? That gangrel creature. He had an ill-favoured look.
FRODO => [The merest hesitation.] There was no other.
FRODO => We set out from Rivendell with seven companions. One we lost in Mria. Two were my kin. A Dwarf there was also, and an Elf. And two men, Aragorn, son of Arathorn, and Boromir of Gondor.
FARAMIR => [Intently] Youre a friend of Boromir?
FRODO => Yes... for my part.
FARAMIR => It will grieve you then to learn that he is dead.
FRODO => [Shocked] Dead? How? When?
FARAMIR => As one of his companions, Id hoped you would tell me. [Pause] He was my brother.
GONDORIAN RANGER => Captain Faramir. [whispers] We found the third one.
FARAMIR => You must come with me. Now.
FARAMIR => [Pointing down] Down there.
FARAMIR => To enter the forbidden pool bears the penalty of death. [He gestures to archers hidden in the bushes.] They wait for my command.
FARAMIR => Shall I shoot?
GOLLUM => [singing] The rock and pool is nice and cool, so juicy sweet! I only wish [Whacks the fish on the rock] to catch a fish [whacks], so juicy sweet! [The fish almost wriggles out of his grasp and he whacks it some more.]
FRODO => Wait! [Faramir stops] This creature is bound to me. And I to him. He is our guide. Please, let me go down to him.
FRODO => Smagol. [Gollum turns round at Frodos voice.] Master is here. Come, Smagol. Trust master. Come!
GOLLUM => We must go now?
FRODO => Smagol, you must trust master. Follow me, come on. Come. Come, Smagol. Nice Smagol. Thats it. Come on.
FRODO => Dont hurt him! Smagol dont struggle! Smagol listen to me!
GOLLUM => [wails] Master!!
GOLLUM => No! No!
FARAMIR => Where are you leading them? Answer me!
GOLLUM => [Cooing, his hand stroking his shoulder] Smagol... Why does it cry, Smagol?
SMAGOL => [Sobbing] Cruel men hurts us. Master trickst us.
GOLLUM => Of course he did. I told you he was tricksy. I told you he was false.
SMAGOL => [Sobbing] Master is our friend... our friend.
GOLLUM => Master betrayed us.
SMAGOL => No, not its business. Leave us alone!
GOLLUM => [Hits his fist against the wall] Filthy little hobbitses. They stole it from us.
SMAGOL => [Whimpers] No... No!
FARAMIR => What did they steal?
GOLLUM => [Turns to Faramir with a ferocious expression] Myyy PRECIOUSSS!! [He bares his teeth and growls] Aaaarrrggghhh!!!
SAM => We have to get out of here. You go. Go, now! You can do it. Use the Ring, Mr. Frodo. Just this once. Put it on. Disappear.
FRODO => I cant. You were right, Sam. You tried to tell me, but Im sorry. The Rings taking me Sam. If I put it on, hell find me. Hell see.
SAM => Mr. Frodo...
FARAMIR => [Unsheathes his sword] So... this is the answer to all the riddles. Here in the wild I have you. Two halflings and a host of men at my call. The Ring of power within my grasp.
FARAMIR => A chance for Faramir, captain of Gondor, to show his quality.
FRODO => No!! [He runs away from Faramir]
SAM => Stop it! Leave him alone! Dont you understand? Hes got to destroy it. Thats where were going. Into Mordor. To the mountain of fire.
DAMROD => Osgiliath is under attack. They call for reinforcements.
SAM => Please. Its such a burden. Will you not help him?
DAMROD => Captain?
FARAMIR => Prepare to leave. The Ring will go to Gondor. [He turns to leave.]
ARAGORN => [Patting Brego on the neck] Mae carnen, Brego, mellon nn. (Well done, Brego, my friend)
REFUGEES => Hes alive!
GIMLI => [Pushing his way through the crowd.] Where is he? Where is he? Get out of the way. Im gonna kill him! [He sees Aragorn.] You are the luckiest, the canniest and the most reckless man I ever knew! [He hugs Aragorn.] Bless you, laddie!
ARAGORN => Gimli, where is the king?
LEGOLAS => Le ab-dollen.  [They smile. Legolas pauses and looks at Aragorns wounds.] You look terrible.
ARAGORN => Hannon le.
THODEN => A great host, you say?
ARAGORN => All Isengard is emptied
THODEN => How many?
ARAGORN => Ten thousand strong at least.
THODEN => Ten thousand?!
ARAGORN => It is an army bred for a single purpose: to destroy the world of men. They will be here by nightfall.
THODEN => Let them come! [Walks away resolutely]
THODEN => [to Gamling] I want every man and strong lad able to bear arms to be ready for battle by nightfall.
THODEN => We will cover the causeway and the gate from above. No army has ever breached the Deeping Wall or set foot inside the Hornburg.
GIMLI => This is no rabble of mindless Orcs. These are Uruk-hai. Their armor is thick and their shields broad.
THODEN => I have fought many wars, Master Dwarf. I know how to defend my own keep.
THODEN => They will break upon this fortress like water on rock. Sarumans hordes will pillage and burn, weve seen it before. Crops can be resown; homes rebuilt. Within these walls, we will outlast them.
ARAGORN => They do not come to destroy Rohans crops or villages. They come to destroy its people. Down to the last child.
THODEN => [Draws close to Aragorn] What would you have me do? Look at my men. Their courage hangs by a thread. If this is to be our end, then I would have them make such an end as to be worthy of remembrance.
ARAGORN => Send out riders, my lord. You must call for aid.
THODEN => And who will come? Elves? Dwarves? We are not so lucky in our friends as you. The old alliances are dead.
ARAGORN => Gondor will answer.
THODEN => Gondor? Where was Gondor when the Westfold fell? Where was Gondor when our enemies closed in around us? Where was Gon No, my lord Aragorn, we are alone. [He walks away, calling out orders] Get the women and children into the caves.
GAMLING => We need more time to lay provisions for a siege, lord
THODEN => [Cutting him off] There is no time. War is upon us!
ROHAN CAPTAIN => [to the soldiers] Secure the gate!
TREEBEARD => We Ents have not troubled about the wars of men and wizards for a very long time. But now something is about to happen that has not happened for an age... Ent Moot.
MERRY => Whats that?
TREEBEARD => 'Tis a gathering.
MERRY => A gathering of what?
TREEBEARD => Beech, oak, chestnut, ash... Good, good, good. Many have come. Now we must decide if the Ents will go to war.
SOLDIER 1 => Move back! Move to the caves!
SOLDIER 2 => Keep moving!
SOLDIER 3 => Quickly now!
ARAGORN => Farmer, farriers, stable boys. These are no soldiers.
GIMLI => Most have seen too many winters.
LEGOLAS => Or too few. Look at them. Theyre frightened. I can see it in their eyes. [The men around them fell silent. Legolas speaks to Aragorn.] Boe a hn: neled herain dan caer menig! (And they should be... Three hundred against ten thousand!)
ARAGORN => Si beriathar hn. Amar n ned Edoras. (They have more hope of defending themselves here than at Edoras.)
LEGOLAS => Aragorn, men i ndagor. Hn -... ortheri. Natha daged aen! (Aragorn, we are warriors. They cannot win this fight. They are all going to die!)
ARAGORN => Then I shall die as one them! [He pauses and then walks away. Legolas makes as if to go after him.]
GIMLI => [Puts a hand on Legolas] Let him go, lad. Let him be.
GAMLING => Every villager able to wield a sword has been sent to the armory. My lord?
THODEN => Who am I, Gamling?
GAMLING => You are our king, sire.
THODEN => And do you trust your king?
GAMLING => [Puts armour onto Thoden] Your men, my lord, will follow you to whatever end.
THODEN => To whatever end Where is the horse and the rider? Where is the horn that was blowing? They have passed like rain on the mountains. Like wind in the meadow. The days have gone down in the west. Behind the hills, into shadow. How did it come to this?
ARAGORN => Give me your sword. What is your name?
HALETH => Haleth, son of Hma, my lord. The men are saying that we will not live out the night. They say that it is hopeless..
ARAGORN => This is a good sword, Haleth, son of Hma.
ARAGORN => There is always hope.
LEGOLAS => We have trusted you this far. You have not led us astray. Forgive me. I was wrong to despair.
ARAGORN => -moe edhored, Legolas. (There is nothing to forgive, Legolas.)
GIMLI => If we had more time Id get this adjusted. [He drops the bundle and the chain mail lands with its length right to the floor.] Its a little tight across the chest.
LEGOLAS => That is no Orc horn. [They run out to the battlements.]
BEREG => [to another guard] Send for the king. Open the gate!
SOLDIER => Open the gate!
THODEN => How is this possible?
HALDIR => I bring word from Elrond of Rivendell. An alliance once existed between Elves and men. Long ago we fought and died together. [He looks up to see Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli running down the steps, and smiles] We come to honor that allegiance.
ARAGORN => [He bows] Mae govannen, Haldir. (Welcome, Haldir) [He grabs Haldir in a huge embrace. Initially stunned, Haldir hugs him back lightly.]
ARAGORN => You are most welcome!
HALDIR => [Turning to Thoden] We are proud to fight alongside men, once more.
GIMLI => [Grumbling and straining to look above the wall.] You could have picked a better spot.
GIMLI => Well lad, whatever luck you live by, lets hope it lasts the night.
LEGOLAS => Your friends are with you, Aragorn.
GIMLI => Lets hope they last the night.
ARAGORN => A Eruchn, -dano i faelas a hyn an uben tanatha le faelas! (Show them no mercy! For you shall receive none!)
GIMLI => [Jumping and straining to see] Whats happening out there?
LEGOLAS => Shall I describe it to you? [Looks at Gimli with a grin] Or would you like me to find you a box?
GIMLI => [Laughs good-naturedly] Hehehehe!!
ARAGORN => Dartho!
THODEN => So it begins.
ARAGORN => Tangado halad!
LEGOLAS => Faeg i-varv dn na lanc a nu ranc. (Their armor is weak at the neck and beneath the arms.)
ARAGORN => Leithio i philinn!
GIMLI => Did they hit anything?
THODEN => Give them a volley.
GAMLING => [to the men] Fire!
MAN-WITH-MISSING-EYE => Fire!
ARAGORN => Fire!
GIMLI => [Impatiently] Send them to me! Cmon!
ARAGORN => Pendraid!
ARAGORN => Swords! Swords!
GIMLI => Good!
GIMLI => Legolas, two already! [Holding up two fingers]
LEGOLAS => Im on seventeen!
GIMLI => [Outraged] Argh! Ill have no pointy-ear outscoring me! [He turns to a Uruk just climbing over the wall, whacking it in the groin with his axe and killing it as it falls.]
LEGOLAS => [Fires two arrows] Nineteen!
PIPPIN => [Gesturing] Merry!
TREEBEARD => We have just agreed. [Long pause with his eyes closed.]
MERRY => [Angles his head in query] Yes?
TREEBEARD => I have told your names to the Ent moot and we have agreed  you are not Orcs.
PIPPIN => Well, thats good news.
MERRY => [impatiently] And what about Saruman? Have you come to a decision about HIM?
TREEBEARD => [Waving a hand] Now dont be hasty, Master Meriadoc.
MERRY => Hasty? Our friends are out there! They need our help! They cannot fight this war on their own.
TREEBEARD => War, yes It affects us all. But you must understand, young hobbit. It takes a loong time to say anything in ooold Entish. [Merry and Pippin roll their eyes in disgruntlement.] And we never say anything unless it is worth taking a looong time to say.
GIMLI => Seventeen! Eighteen! Nineteen! Twenty! Twenty-one! Twenty-two!
ARAGORN => Na fennas!  [Directs the Elf archers to aim at the Uruk-hai column.]
THODEN => Is this it? Is this all you can conjure, Saruman?
ARAGORN => Togo hon dad, Legolas! (Bring him down, Legolas!) [Legolas shoots the Uruk-hai in the shoulder but the latter keeps going] Dago hon! Dago hon! (Kill him! Kill him!)
THODEN => Brace the Gate! Hold them! Stand firm!
GIMLI => Aragorn!! Argh!
ARAGORN => Gimli! [He yells to the Elves behind him] Hado i philinn!
ARAGORN => Herio!
TREEBEARD => The Ents cannot hold back this storm. We must weather such things as we have always done.
MERRY => How can that be your decision?!
TREEBEARD => This is not our war.
MERRY => But you're part of this world! Arent you?! [The Ents look at one another, taken back] You must help, please! You must do something!
TREEBEARD => You are young and brave, Master Merry. But your part in this tale is over. Go back to your home.
PIPPIN => Maybe Treebeards right. We dont belong here, Merry. It's too big for us. What can we do in the end? We've got the Shire. Maybe we should go home.
MERRY => [Looking into the distance.] The fires of Isengard will spread. And the woods of Tuckborough and Buckland will burn. And all that was once green and good in this world will be gone. [Turns to Pippin and puts a hand on his shoulder] There won't be a Shire, Pippin.
GAMLING => Aragorn! Fall back to the Keep! Get your men out of there!
ARAGORN => Na Barad! Na Baraad! Haldir, na Barad! (To the Keep! Pull back to the Keep! Haldir, to the Keep!)
GIMLI => [Protesting] What are you doing? Argh! What are you stopping for!
ARAGORN => [Sees Haldir falling] HALDIR!! [He runs up the steps to Haldirs side and catches him and he collapses. Haldir's head rolls back, his eyes empty and unseeing. Aragorn bows his head in grief. Then with a cry, he jumps onto a ladder and swings down to the ground, killing as he goes.]
GAMLING => Brace the gate!
SOLDIER => Hold them!
THODEN => [Drawing his sword] To the gate! Draw your swords!
GAMLING => Make way! We cannot hold much longer.
THODEN => Hold them!
ARAGORN => [Runs up and stabs away at the Uruk-hai through the broken gate] How long do you need?
GAMLING => Brace the gate!
THODEN => As long as you can give me!
ARAGORN => Gimli!
THEODEN => Timbers! Brace the Gate!
GIMLI => Come on! We can take em!
ARAGORN => Its a long way.
GIMLI => [Mumbles] Toss me.
ARAGORN => What?
GIMLI => I cannot jump the distance! Youll have to toss me!
GIMLI => Oh! [Gimli stays Aragorns hand] Dont tell the Elf.
ARAGORN => Not a word.
GIMLI => [Making quick work of killing the Uruk-hai] ARGH!!
THODEN => Shore up the door!
SOLDIER 1 => Make way!
SOLDIER 2 => Follow me to the barricade.
SOLDIER 3 => Watch our backs!
SOLDIER 4 => Throw another one over here!
THODEN => Higher!
SOLDIER => Hold fast the gate!]
THODEN => [Through a crack in the gate] Gimli! Aragorn! Get out of there!
LEGOLAS => Aragorn! [He throws them a rope]
THODEN => Pull everybody back! Pull them back!
GAMLING => Fall back! Fall back!
THODEN => Theyve broken through! The castle is breached. Retreat!
GAMLING => Fall back!
THODEN => Retreat!
ARAGORN => Hurry! Inside! Get them inside!
GAMLING => Into the Keep!
TREEBEARD => I will leave you at the western borders of the forest. You can make your way north to your homeland from there.
PIPPIN => Wait! Stop! Stop! [Treebeard comes to a stop.] Turn around. Turn around. Take us south!
TREEBEARD => South? But that will lead you past Isengard.
PIPPIN => Yes. Exactly. If we go south we can slip past Saruman unnoticed. The closer we are to danger, the farther we are from harm. Its the last thing hell expect.
TREEBEARD => Mmmm. That doesnt make sense to me. But then, you are very small. Perhaps youre right. South it is then. Hold on, little Shirelings. I always like going south. Somehow it feels like going down hill.
MERRY => Are you mad? Well be caught!
PIPPIN => No we wont. Not this time.
RANGER 1 => Look! Osgiliath burns!
RANGER 2 => Mordor has come.
FRODO => [With tears in his eyes] The Ring will not save Gondor. It has only the power to destroy. Please, let me go.
FARAMIR => Hurry. [He presses them on]
FRODO => Faramir, you must let me go!
TREEBEARD => And a little family of field mice that climb up sometimes and they tickle me awfully. Theyre always trying to get somewhere where they  Oh!! [He sees the desolated landscape of tree stumps that used to be forested grounds] Many of these trees were my friends. Creatures I had known from nut and acorn.
PIPPIN => Im sorry, Treebeard.
TREEBEARD => [With tears in his eyes] They had voices of their own. [His gaze turns to the treeless Isengard and its smoking caverns] Saruman! A wizard should know better!
TREEBEARD => There is no curse in Elvish, Entish or the tongues of men for this treachery. My business is with Isengard tonight. With rock and stone!
MERRY => Yes!
TREEBEARD => Hoorarooom... Come my friends. The Ents are going to war. It is likely that we go to our doom. Last march of the Ents!
MADRIL => Faramir, Orcs have taken the eastern shore. Their numbers are too great. By nightfall well be overrun.
SAM => Mr Frodo!
FRODO => Its calling to him, Sam. His eye is almost on me.
SAM => Hold on, Mr. Frodo You'll be alright...
FARAMIR => Take them to my father. Tell him Faramir sends a mighty gift. A weapon that will change our fortunes in this war.
SAM => Do you want to know what happened to Boromir? You want to know why your brother died? He tried to take the Ring from Frodo! After swearing an oath to protect him, he tried to kill him! The Ring drove your brother mad!
RANGER => Watch out!
SAM => Mr Frodo?
FRODO => [In a faraway voice] Theyre here. Theyve come.
FARAMIR => [Looking up] NAZGL!! [He grabs the hobbits and thrusts them into a corner.] Stay here. Keep out of sight. [To his men] Take cover!
THODEN => The fortress is taken. It is over.
ARAGORN => [Carrying a table with Legolas to shore up the door of the hall] You said this fortress would never fall while your men defend it! They still defend it! They have died defending it!
WOMAN => They are breaking in!
ARAGORN => Is there no other way for the women and children to get out of the caves? [There is no answer.] Is there no other way?
GAMLING => There is one passage. It leads into the mountains. But they will not get far. The Uruk-hai are too many.
ARAGORN => Send word for the women and children to make for the mountain pass. And barricade the entrance.
THODEN => So much death. What can men do against such reckless hate?
ARAGORN => [Pause] Ride out with me. Ride out and meet them.
THODEN => [A light of determination shines in his eyes] For death and glory.
ARAGORN => For Rohan. For your people.
GIMLI => The sun is rising.
GANDALF => Look to my coming at first light on the fifth day. At dawn, look to the east.
THODEN => Yes. Yes! The horn of Helm Hammerhand shall sound in the deep one last time!
GIMLI => Yes! [Gimli runs up the steps to the horn of Helm Hammerhand]
THODEN => Let this be the hour when we draw swords together. Fell deeds awake. Now for wrath! Now for ruin! And a red dawn!
THODEN => FORTH EORLINGAS!!
ARAGORN => Gandalf.
GANDALF => Thoden king stands alone.
OMER => [Coming up from behind] Not alone. [He raises a hand] Rohirrim!!
THODEN => [Looking to the east] omer!
OMER => To the king!
PIPPIN => Yes!
TREEBEARD => A hit. A fine hit!
TREEBEARD => Break the dam! Release the river!
MERRY => Pippin, hold on! [The hobbits tighten their hold on top of Treebeard]
TREEBEARD => Hold on, little hobbits!
SAM => What are you doing? Where are you going?!
[SLOW MOTION => Frodo walks up some stairs and stands on a bridge. A Nazgl on a Fell beast emerges in front of him. Frodo stares at the Nazgl, fixated. Feeling the call of the Ring, he holds it up. Faramir watches the unfolding tableau from below. As Frodo moves to put the Ring on his finger and the Nazgl flies closer and closer, Sam runs up and knocks Frodo over. Faramir releases an arrow and shoots the Fell Beast. Frodo and Sam roll down the stairs. As they come to a stop at the bottom, Frodo holds Sam in a death grip, yells and points Sting at his throat, his eyes livid with madness and anger that someone would try to take the Ring away.]
FRODO => Aaarrgghh!!!
SAM => [With tears running down his face] Its me. Its your Sam. Dont you know your Sam?
FRODO => [Slowly and with despair] I cant do this, Sam.
SAM => [Getting up slowly] I know. Its all wrong. By rights we shouldnt even be here. But we are. [He stands and leans against a wall, looking out into the distance.] Its like in the great stories, Mr. Frodo. The ones that really mattered. Full of darkness and danger they were. And sometimes you didnt want to know the end. Because how could the end be happy? [Images of the riders winning the battle against the Uruk-hai at Helms Deep] How could the world go back to the way it was when so much bad had happened?
THODEN => Victory! We have victory! [He raises his sword with a victorious cry]
SAM => But in the end, its only a passing thing, this shadow. [The women and children welcome the men as they return. owyn runs up to Aragorn and embraces him, crying tears of relief.] Even darkness must pass. A new day will come. [Isengard is flooded. Merry and Pippin looks on from their perch on Treebeard. On the balcony, Saruman stumbles back into his chamber] And when the sun shines it will shine out the clearer. Those were the stories that stayed with you. That meant something, even if you were too small to understand why. But I think, Mr. Frodo, I do understand. I know now. Folk in those stories had lots of chances of turning back only they didnt. They kept going because they were holding on to something.
FRODO => What are we holding on to, Sam?
SAM => Theres some good in this world, Mr. Frodo. And its worth fighting for.
FARAMIR => I think at last we understand one another, Frodo Baggins.
MADRIL => You know the laws of our country, the laws of your father. If you let them go, your life will be forfeit.
FARAMIR => Then it is forfeit. Release them.
GANDALF => Saurons wrath will be terrible, his retribution swift. The battle for Helms Deep is over. The battle for Middle-earth is about to begin. All our hopes now lie with two little hobbits. Somewhere in the wilderness.
SAM => I wonder if well ever be put into songs or tales.
FRODO => What?
SAM => I wonder if people will ever say, lets hear about Frodo and the Ring. And theyll say yes, thats one of my favorite stories. Frodo was really courageous, wasnt he, dad. Yes, my boy, the most famousest of hobbits. And thats saying alot.
FRODO => Huh, you left out one of the chief characters Samwise the Brave. I want to hear more about Sam.
FRODO => Frodo wouldnt have got far without Sam.
SAM => Now Mr. Frodo, you shouldnt make fun. I was being serious.
FRODO => [smiling] So was I. [He turns to walk on]
SAM => [Dreamily] Samwise the Brave. [He gives his backpack a heave and follows Frodo]
FRODO => Smagol!
SAM => Were not gonna wait for you. Come on!
SMAGOL => Master... Master looks after us. Master wouldnt hurt us.
GOLLUM => Master broke his promise.
SMAGOL => Dont ask Smagol. Poor, poor Smagol.
GOLLUM => Master betrayed us! Wicked, tricksy, false. We ought to wring his filthy little neck. [Twists the branch of a tree] Kill him! Kill him! Kill them both. And then we take the precious and we be the master.
SMAGOL => [Scuttles and hides behind a tree] The fat hobbit, he knows. Eyes always watching.
GOLLUM => Then we stabs them out. Put out his eyeses. And make HIM crawl.
SMAGOL => [Bites on his finger and nods eagerly] Yes! Yes! Yes!
GOLLUM => Kill them both.
SMAGOL => Yes! No no! [Backs away against a tree] Its too risky, its too risky.
SAM => Wheres he gone? Hey Gollum, where are you?
FRODO => Smagol?
GOLLUM => [Softly and sinisterly] We could let HER do it.
SMAGOL => Yes. She could do it.
GOLLUM => Yes, precious she could. And then we takes it once theyre dead.
SMAGOL => Once theyre dead
GOLLUM => Shh [He pops out from hiding in front of the hobbits.]
SMAGOL => Come on, hobbits. Long ways to go yet. Smagol will show you the way.
GOLLUM => Follow me.
