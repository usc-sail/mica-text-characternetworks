HUSHPUPPY => All the time, everywhere, everything's organs be beatin' and squirtin' and talkin' to each other in ways I can't understand. Mosta the time they probably just sayin' "I'm hungry," or "I gotta poop," but sometimes they talkin' in codes.
MAN => Get up, get out of here!
WINK => Get your pants on, man!
WINK => Feed up time! Feed up!
HUSHPUPPY => Feed up time! Feed up!
WINK => Share with the dogs.
WINK => Ain't that ugly over there?
WINK => We live in the prettiest place on earth.
HUSHPUPPY => Daddy says, up above the levee, on the dry side, they're afraid of the water like a bunch of babies. They built the wall that cuts us off.
HUSHPUPPY => They think we all gonna drown down here. But we ain't goin' nowhere.
HUSHPUPPY => The Bathtub's got more holidays than the whole rest of the world.
HUSHPUPPY => Daddy always saying, that up in the dry world, they got none of what we got.
HUSHPUPPY => They only got holidays once a year.
ANNOUNCER => All babies to the race! Come up to the starting line! The baby race is about to begin.
HUSHPUPPY => They got fish stuck in plastic wrappers, they got their babies stuck in carriages, and chickens on sticks and all that kind of stuff.
HUSHPUPPY => One day, the storm's gonna blow, the ground's gonna sink, and the water's gonna rise up so high, there ain't gonna be no Bathtub, just a whole bunch of water.
HUSHPUPPY => But me and my Daddy, we stay right here. We who the earth is for.
WOMAN => Meat.
MISS BATHSHEBA => MEAT. MEAT. MEAT.
MISS BATHSHEBA => Every animal is made out of meat. I am meat, ya'll asses meat. Everything is part of the buffet of the universe.
MISS BATHSHEBA => This here, is an Aurochs.
MISS BATHSHEBA => A fierce, mean creature that roamed the earth back when we all lived in caves. They would gobble the cave- babies down right in front of their cave-parents. And the cavemen couldn't do nothing about it, because they were too poor, too stupid, too small. Who here thinks the Cavemen were sitting around crying like a buncha pussies?
MISS BATHSHEBA => Y'all better think about that. Cause any day now, the fabric of the universe is coming unraveled. The ice caps gonna melt, the water's gonna rise, and everything south of the levee's going under.
MISS BATHSHEBA => Ain't gonna be no Bathtub, just a whole bunch of water. Y'all better learn to survive.
HUSHPUPPY => Way back in the day, the Aurochs was king of the world.
HUSHPUPPY => If it wasn't for giant snowballs, and the iced age. I wouldn't even be Hushpuppy, I would just be breakfast.
HUSHPUPPY => Daddy? Feed-up time. Feed-up?
HUSHPUPPY => Daddy?
HUSHPUPPY => DADDY!?
HUSHPUPPY => Kids that got no Mamma, no Daddy and nobody. They got to live in the woods, and eat grass, and steal underpants.
HUSHPUPPY => Daddy? Daddy?
HUSHPUPPY => If Daddy don't get home soon, it's gonna be time for me to start eating my pets.
MISS BATHSHEBA => You need a ride, boo?
HUSHPUPPY => My Daddy's coming to pick me up.
MISS BATHSHEBA => How about food or something, you hungry?
MISS BATHSHEBA => Alright, well suit yourself.
HUSHPUPPY => Everything we still got from Mamma, we keep in my house.
HUSHPUPPY => Daddy says, the first time she looked at me, it made her heart beat so big, that she thought it would blow up. That's why she swam away.
MARIETTA => Hi my sweet baby.
HUSHPUPPY => Hi momma.
MARIETTA => Hushpuppy what you doing there? You being good like I taught you?
HUSHPUPPY => Yes, mamma.
MARIETTA => You're good, you make me happy / you're good, you make me happy.
HUSHPUPPY => That's pretty Mamma.
MARIETTA => You're pretty Hushpuppy.
WINK => Get out of my way you fat animal!
HUSHPUPPY => Daddy! Daddy, Daddy!
HUSHPUPPY => I learned lots of stuff while you gone. If I drink all this here I can burp like a man.
HUSHPUPPY => How come you wearing a dress?
WINK => Leave me alone, Man.
HUSHPUPPY => You wearing a bracelet too?
WINK => Go in your house, you wouldn't understand.
HUSHPUPPY => I wanna come in your house.
HUSHPUPPY => I WANNA COME IN YOUR HOUSE!
WINK => GO AHEAD!
WINK =>  Hushpuppy!? Boss lady!? Hushpuppy where you at!?
HUSHPUPPY => If Daddy kill me, I ain't gonna be forgotten, I'm recording my story for the scientists of the future.
WINK => HUSHPUPPY!? Where are you Boss!?
HUSHPUPPY => In a million years, when kids go to school, they gonna know that once there was Hushpuppy and she lived with her Daddy in the Bathtub.
WINK => BOSS LADY?
WINK => Don't you run away from me. I swear to GOD Hushpuppy!
HUSHPUPPY => I'm tearing off!
WINK => You ain't tearing off nothin', I'll bust your ass!
HUSHPUPPY => I'm tearing off just like my Momma.
WINK => Come on!
WINK => See what happens. See what happens to you!
WINK => See what you making me do? You're killing me!
WINK => Get up and now come on.
HUSHPUPPY => I hope you do die! And after you die, I come to your grave and eat birthday cake all by myself!
HUSHPUPPY => Momma!? Momma!? MOMMA!? I think I broke something.
HUSHPUPPY => Miss Bathsheba! Miss Bathsheba! My Daddy fell down!
MISS BATHSHEBA => It's gonna be OK baby.
MISS BATHSHEBA => Ok, Hushpuppy, here's what I need you to do. You take this medicine and run as fast as you can. Go!
HUSHPUPPY => Daddy could have turned into a tree, or a bug. There wasn't any way to know.
HUSHPUPPY => The whole universe depends on everything fitting together just right. If one piece busts, even the smallest piece, the entire universe will get busted.
BOY => The storm's coming! The storm's coming!
LITTLE JO => Look at these assholes running around all over the damn place. C'est la vie assholes!
WINK => I know y'all with me. Y'all doin' the storm.
LITTLE JO => Lady Jo's ain't never closed honey.
WINK => That's what I'm talking about. Walrus my big man, you staying?
WALRUS => Wrong number buddy. I'm outta here as soon as I finish my beer.
WINK => You ain't goin nowhere.
WALRUS => This ain't no sneeze comin' out the gulf. I'm gone brother.
WINK => I'll see you tomorrow Walrus. Lookit there, Winston's with me.
WINK => What you doing about the storm Winston?
WALRUS => Hey! It's Hushpuppy.
EVERYBODY => Hushpuppy! Hushpuppy's here.
WINK => Hushpuppy? Where you been?
HUSHPUPPY => What happened to y-
WINK => Shut-up!
WINK => You don't talk!
WINK => This side is still Wink's house. No toys, and no girl stuff over here.
WINK => So if I want to come over that side and smack you in the face, that's against the rules. So there's a plus for you.
WINK => Now come on down here and get in the boat, man.
WINK => If the water get real high, we gonna float to the top and we gonna bust through the roof and we gonna ride away, okay?
WINK => You never NEVER take these off. I'm your Daddy, and you do what I tell you to do, because it's my job to keep you from dying, ok? So sit back and just listen to me... Close your eyes and go to sleep. CLOSE YOUR EYES!
WINK => Why you starin' at me like that? I can't sleep with you starin' at me like that.
WINK => Listen. You need to understand, you're a kid and I'm a man.
WINK => What, you scared?
WINK => Don't be scared, no storm can't beat no Doucet. I'm gonna show you. You watch.
WINK => I'm'll show you! We Doucets we're not scared of no damn storm.
WINK => Look at me! Look at me Hushpuppy! Watch me kick butt.
WINK => Hell yea! I'm right here! I'm right here I ain't going nowhere. AHHHHHH!!!
HUSHPUPPY => Mamma!? MAMMA!?
HUSHPUPPY => For every animal that didn't have a Dad to put it in a boat, the end of the world already happened. They're all down below, trying to breathe through water.
WINK => Yo Winston?
WINK => Edison? Ow-Wee!
WINK => Some day when I'm gone, you gonna be the last man in the bathtub. You have to learn how to feed your house.
WINK => Now, stick your left hand in this water, stick it in there.
WINK => Ok, what you do is you hold your hand steady and you just wait for your fish to come. You gotta ball your fist up, this is your punching hand. Ball your fist up in case you have to whack it when they come up.
WINK => WHOOOOO YEA! Whooo lord, look what we got. I gotcha. Say "I gotcha!"
HUSHPUPPY => I gotcha!
WINK => Yea! Hold him down! Now, you hold it down like this, and whack him good with your fist.
WINK => Go ahead whack him! You whack him good. Hold him like that and whack him!
HUSHPUPPY => OW!
WINK => You OK? That's all a part of it.
WINK => You wanna try it again?
WINK => Come on. One more time.
HUSHPUPPY => Daddy?
HUSHPUPPY => Mamma? Is that you?
HUSHPUPPY => I've broken everything.
HUSHPUPPY => Strong animals, they know when your hearts are weak. That makes them hungry and they start coming.
WALRUS => Holy bowlegged Sarah!
WINK => Hey partner! Hey Walrus!
WALRUS =>  I musta passed out.
WINK => Little Jo!
LITTLE JO => Wink!?
LITTLE JO =>  You don't touch me you filthy bastard!  Wink, you get me.
LITTLE JO => Goin' on all night `bout how tonight's the last night on earth we gotta make it count. Talkin' dirty right in front of Peter T.
WALRUS => Sorry Peter T.
WINK => Peter T, my man! I knew you wasn't gonna leave me man!
PETER T => Oh no, oh no.
WALRUS =>  That is one classic dude right there.
WINK => Peter T, you are a titan! Glad you stayed man! RHHAAAA!
WALRUS => If I had wings, I know I could have flown in that bad boy. But I would have probably bounced off a tree, or...
WINK => Hushpuppy! Did I ever tell you the story of your conception?
WINK => When me and Hushpuppy's Mamma first met we was so shy, we used to sit around, and drink beer, and smile at each other. One day we was so shy we just napped...
HUSHPUPPY => Back when Daddy used to talk about Mamma, he'd say she was so pretty she never even had to turn on the stove.
HUSHPUPPY => She just walk into a room and water start to boil.
WINK => Your Momma battered that gator up, and set it to fry.
WINK => ...and Hushpuppy popped into the universe maybe four minutes later.
WINK => I got it under control.
HUSHPUPPY => Miss Bathsheba!?
WINK => Come on lets go! Time to eat! Come on children, feed up time!
JEAN BATTISTE => To the last of the food!
WALRUS => To the last of the water!
LITTLE JO => You ain't drinkin' no water.
MISS BATHSHEBA => Yea, tastes like more, alright!
HUSHPUPPY => For the ones we'd never find, we make a funeral the Bathtub way, with no crying allowed.
WALRUS => When the water goes down, I'm gonna French kiss the dirt!
MISS BATHSHEBA => Water's not goin' down man.
WINK => Nah, that's my beautiful place under there.
MISS BATHSHEBA => Man you know they got plenty of salt coming into that water, everything beautiful is gone. Trees are gonna dies first, then the animals, then the fish.
WINK => I got it under control.
JEAN BATTISTE => Come on Hushpuppy, come over here lemme show you how.
JEAN BATTISTE => Here baby. You hold like this, then you turn it over like that.
JEAN BATTISTE => Don't be scared of it now. Now, you take this knife, and you pop this off.
JEAN BATTISTE => Atta girl.
WINK => NO! Hushpuppy--
WINK => Beast it!
MISS BATHSHEBA => You heard your Daddy. Beast it.
EVERYONE =>  BEAST IT! BEAST IT! BEAST IT!
WINK => Yea! You see what kinda family we got?! We got feeling!
HUSHPUPPY => It wasn't no time to sit around crying like a bunch of pussies.
HUSHPUPPY => We was gonna build a camp right on top of the Bathtub.
HUSHPUPPY => We got enough animals to eat until the water goes down.
MISS BATHSHEBA =>  Come here, like this.
MISS BATHSHEBA => Like this. Tee-Lou get some water.
MISS BATHSHEBA => Quick little circles. Good for the heart. Joy Strong?
MISS BATHSHEBA => This is most important thing I can ever teach y'all. You got to take care of people that's smaller and sweeter than you are.
MISS BATHSHEBA => That's better.
HUSHPUPPY => Two weeks later, everything started to die.
WINK =>  Come on fishes, where y'at?
HUSHPUPPY =>  You wanna leave the Bathtub, Walrus?
WALRUS =>  Nah.
WINK => I heard that.
WINK => Nobody's leaving the Bathtub! You don't know nothing!
WINK =>  This water gonna kill us here. We gotta do something `bout this. I ain't starvin' to death while them people go grocery shopping up there.
JEAN BATTISTE => Shit!
WINK => Boss, Daddy's gotta take care of something.
WINK => I'm gonna fix everything back how it was.
HUSHPUPPY => Everything gonna go right back?
WINK => Hell yeah, we gonna win.
WINK => Boss, anything go wrong, Walrus is Daddy.
WINK => You're gonna be the king of the Bathtub, I promise that.
WINK => Just sit here I'll be right back.
WALRUS =>  I think they be gone. I-I really can't say where.
MISS BATHSHEBA => Walrus, don't make me slap your ass! They go to the levee!?
MISS BATHSHEBA => You so much as piss on that wall, you know what them people gonna do? They gonna smoke us out and stick us in a damn shelter.
HUSHPUPPY => Daddy says, brave men don't run from their home.
WINK =>  Peter T, don't hold onto me, hold onto the boat. You gonna be fine.
WINK => Peter T, you hold the trip-line.
PETER T =>  Ok then.
WINK => Just don't pull `til I say.
PETER T => Ok then.
WINK => You can do it. I have complete faith in you.
PETER T => Ok.
JEAN BATTISTE => Lock and load.
HUSHPUPPY => The entire universe depends on everything fitting together just right. If you can fix the broken piece, it can all go right back.
WINK => Peter T hand me the-
WINK => Peter you didn't drop the trip- line?
PETER T => No I did not.
PETER T => Oh, yes I did.
JEAN BATTISTE => Oh, Peter T.
PETER T => I'm sorry.

MISS BATHSHEBA => Hushpuppy!?
JEAN BATTISTE => She got it! Pull! Pull!
WINK => NOW BOSS!
MISS BATHSHEBA => No! Hushpuppy!
HUSHPUPPY => It didn't matter that the water was gone. Sometimes, you can break something so bad, that it can't get put back together.
HUSHPUPPY => Mamma!?
HUSHPUPPY => Mamma where you at!?
PILOT => This is a mandatory evacuation area, you can no longer live here. Everyone in this area, has to leave. I repeat....
HUSHPUPPY => When you're small, you gotta fix what you can.

WINK => I ain't gon' leave nothing.
HUSHPUPPY => Cause if you be gone, I be gone too.
WINK => Hushpuppy, that is not how it works.
HUSHPUPPY => I will. Sometimes in the bed I start shaking and can't stop. I got what you got.
WINK => No man. That's just a side effect of being a stupid little girl.
HUSHPUPPY => I ain't gonna be dead?
WINK => No. You? No! You gonna live a hundred years more. You know what, show me the guns.
WINK => Show me them guns man.

HUSHPUPPY => They the type of animals that eats their own Mommas and Daddies.
EVACUATOR =>  This is a mandatory evacuation area. Everyone in this region has to leave.
WINK => We ain't going nowhere!

EVACUATOR 2 => Relax, relax ma'am.
LITTLE JO => YOU SON OF A BITCH!
WINK => Get your hands off of her! I'm gonna kill you! Let her go!
HUSHPUPPY => It didn't look like a prison, it looked like a fish tank with no water.
WINK => Don't eat that.
DR. MALONEY => Mr. Doucet, can I have a word with you, we found something in your test. It's-
WINK => Whoa whoa whoa, not in front of my kid. Stay, Hushpuppy.
DR. MALONEY => Mr. Doucet, there's no easy way to say this...

WINK => I don't need nothing from you! You keep your hands off her! I don't need nothing from y'all! Let me go!
HUSHPUPPY => Daddy!
BABYSITTER => Hushpuppy needs a hug.
HUSHPUPPY => I don't want your hug!
BABYSITTER => Hushpuppy, that's not how nice girls act. Say "I'm sorry ma'am." Hey! Say it. Say it or you're going to corner time.
ORDERLY =>  There there, sir.
HUSHPUPPY => When an animal gets sick here, they plug it into the wall.
HUSHPUPPY => They're coming for you.
HUSHPUPPY => Daddy says, if he ever got so old he couldn't drink beer, or catch catfish, that I had to put him in a boat, and set him on fire, so no one could come plug him into the wall.
WINK => Boss. Let's go.
HUSHPUPPY => Where we goin'?

WINK => No. Hushpuppy... I can't take care of you no more.
HUSHPUPPY => Yes you can.
WINK => Daddy's dying!
WINK => My blood is eating itself. You know what that means?
HUSHPUPPY => Don't be sayin' about dying.
WINK => Everybody's Daddy dies.
HUSHPUPPY => Not my Daddy.
WINK => Yes, your Daddy!
WINK => I didn't want you to watch that, ok? You understand?
HUSHPUPPY => Come on! Come on!
WINK => Walrus, get me home.
HUSHPUPPY => Everybody looses the thing that made them, it's even how it's supposed to be in nature.
HUSHPUPPY => The brave men stay and watch it happen. They don't run.
HUSHPUPPY => Come on! Keep going!
HUSHPUPPY => I'm going by my Mamma.
SERGEANT MAJOR => That's a good place to go.
HUSHPUPPY => Which way are we going?
SERGEANT MAJOR => Don't matter baby, this boat'll take you exactly where you need to be. It's just that type of boat.
SERGEANT MAJOR => You want a chicken biscuit?
SERGEANT MAJOR => They're good for you.
SERGEANT MAJOR => I been eating these all my life. I keep the wrappers in the boat, `cause they remind me who I was when I ate each one. The smell make me feel cohesive.
HUSHPUPPY => I wanna be cohesive.
SERGEANT MAJOR => Oh you will be, I got no doubt in my mind.
MISS FRANKIE => Holy crap you have toddlers!
SERGEANT MAJOR => Good afternoon, Miss Frankie.
MISS FRANKIE => Well butter my butt and call me a biscuit! How you, Sergeant Major? You need some grits?
SERGEANT MAJOR => Yes ma'am.

COOK => Get in here, I'm'll show you a magic trick.
COOK => Lemme tell you somethin', when you're a child people tell you that everything's gonna be all hunky- dory and all that bullshit, but I'm here to tell you that it's not. So get that out your head right now.
COOK => Life's some big old feast, yeah, but you? You ain't nothin' but a stupid little waitress.
COOK => Everything you got on your platter gonna fall on the floor and ain't nobody gonna be there to pick it up for you. Someday it's all gonna be on you.
COOK => So smile, girl.
COOK => Nobody likes a pity-party-having- ass-woman.
COOK => The gator's magic.
COOK =>  Awwwwwwwww.
COOK => Mmm-hmm.
HUSHPUPPY => You can take care of me. Me and Daddy.
COOK => I don't know nothing bout your Daddy, I can't take care of nobody but myself.
COOK => You can stay if you want.
HUSHPUPPY => This is my favorite thing.
COOK => I know.
HUSHPUPPY => I can count all the time I've been lifted.
HUSHPUPPY => I can count all the times I've been lifted on two fingers.
WOMAN => Wink! Bring my baby here! They need to wash her off.
WINK => Naw, that waits.
WINK =>  Alright fatso, breathe some air.
HUSHPUPPY => I need to go home.
COOK =>  No.
HUSHPUPPY => You're my friend, kind of.
HUSHPUPPY => I gotta take care of mine.
WINK =>  Real good.
WINK =>  No crying, you hear?
HUSHPUPPY => No crying.
PETER T => As I stand by the bayou,
EVERYONE => A ship at my side starts her motors and sails for the gulf. I watch her until she disappears. "There! 
EVERYONE => She's gone!" Gone where? Gone from my eyes, that's all. She's just as big as when she left me. And somewhere else, other voices are calling out, "Here she comes!" And that is dying.
EVERYONE => HERE! SHE! COMES!
HUSHPUPPY => When I relax behind my eyes I see everything that made me flying around in invisible pieces. When I look too hard it goes away, but when it all goes quiet, I see they are right here.
HUSHPUPPY => I see that I'm a little piece of a big, big universe, and that makes things right.
HUSHPUPPY => When I die, the scientists of the future, they gonna find it all. They gonna know, once there was a Hushpuppy, and she lived with her Daddy in the Bathtub.
