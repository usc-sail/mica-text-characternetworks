GIRL => Idiot!
TERRENCE =>  Where are you, you sick bastard...
TERRENCE => Taxi! Ici, s'il vous plait!
TERRENCE => My God! Help! Au securs!
GORD => Man. I can't believe I paid good money to watch a guy in tight pants kill a cow.
SHERRY => Disgusting. This makes American Gladiators look highbrow.
ANDY => Whoo! Ole!  Man, you guys are losers! This is poetry! Death in the afternoon, a tragic dance of man and beast, just like Hemingway said. God, Spain is it! These people know how to live.
SHERRY => I still say we should've gone to Paris.
ANDY => Paris!? Ug! If I wanted to be in an overpriced, overrated city full of obnoxious assholes I would've stayed in New York! Please!
GORD => Where've you been? Beatin' off in your sombrero again?
MIKE => McDermott, your dad sent this to the pensione. Supposed to be urgent.
ANDY =>  What's it about?
MIKE =>  I didn't read it.
MIKE => His uncle is in the hospital.
GORD => Hey, man. You okay? What is it?
ANDY => Um, excuse me... hello...
WOMAN =>  Pitou needs a real doctor! He's melancholy!
ANDY => Hey, wait a minute...
ANDY => Pardon... Excusez moi. 'Allo.
ANDY =>  Umm...
ANDY => So, you ever been to Spain? You'd love it. It's friendly, sunny, cheap... And you'd be the only raving bitch there instead of just one in the crowd up here.
MARCEL => Andrew Mc-dair-mo?
ANDY => That's McDermott, but yeah.
MARCEL => Detective Boulard. We've been expecting you. This is Inspector Leduc.
MARCEL => He's in charge but, uh, between you and me, my English is better. (they hurry to catch up with LeDuc) This way... So you're from New York eh? I love those Hill Street Blues...
ANDY => Right. Listen, my uncle, it's not serious is it? Did he eat some bad snails? Slip on the bidet? What?
LEDUC => Merde.
MARCEL => He says -
ANDY => Yeah okay. My French isn't that bad.
ANDY => Jesus...
MARCEL => How well did, er, do you know him?
ANDY => Not too well. He taught at the Sorbonne, right? Dad always calls him his "hippie brother". Did some work with Timothy Leary I think, and - Is he... is he going to die?
MARCEL => No. The doctors say the machines should keep him going a long time. But basically he is, how you say, a legume.
ANDY => Legume? You mean, a vegetable?
MARCEL => Vegetable, right. My mistake. It seems he was attacked by a maniac, maybe two or three maniacs, just after midnight. yesterday. They fled into the tunnels beneath Paris, that's all we know...
ANDY => What do you mean, maniacs?
MARCEL => Well, here's what I think happened. A chemistry professor goes to a bad part of town late at night. Why? Perhaps he's making a few francs on the side. The psychedelic drug market is big these days. He gets mixed up with a bad crowd and, like they say, if you lie with dogs, you get fleas.
ANDY => Yeah, well, these fleas must have teeth like fuckin' chain saws.
MARCEL => Maybe we should go now. You must be very tired. We'll call if any new -
ANDY => I can't believe this. Why don't you go down in the tunnels and find the goddamn... animals that attacked my uncle?
MARCEL => Andy, it's not so easy. There are hundreds of kilometers of tunnels under Paris. It's a whole other city, crawling with drug addicts, lunatics, skinheads... It's no man's land.
LEDUC => Here.
MARCEL => Your uncle was carrying this. The keys to his apartment are in there. I talked to his assistant, Madame Flocquet. You'll be staying there a while?
ANDY => Yeah. I guess so. (they walk him to the elevator) Did he say anything? Before the coma?
MARCEL => Just the name of this hospital, St. Severin. He repeated it a few times then he lost consciousness.
ANDY => Why would he pick this one?
MARCEL => I don't know. There were others much closer. He was religious?
ANDY => Not that I know.
MARCEL => Well, when you're about to pop off, what have you got to lose? Thanks for your help.
MARCEL => And remember Andy, let's be careful out there. Heh-heh... Ouch!
ANDY =>  Inspector Clouseau, on the case. Great.
ANDY => This must be the place.
YOUNG WOMAN =>  Who are you!? What do you want!?
ANDY => Don't shoot! Jesus... uh... Je m'appelle Andy. McDermott. Je suis le... um, shit...
SERAFINE =>  Oh fuck, you are his nephew...
ANDY => Yeah, that's the word. And you are?
SERAFINE => Serafine Flocquet. I work for your uncle.
ANDY => You? You're Madame Flocquet? I pictured a fat lady with an apron, not - I don't know - La Femme Nikita.
SERAFINE => It sounded like someone picking the lock. After what happened, I guess I am a little nervous.
ANDY => Sure. I can follow that.
SERAFINE => It's a fucking nightmare, isn't it?
ANDY => Yeah. True. The cops weren't much help either. Their theory is he was moonlighting as a drug dealer or something. Make sense to you?
SERAFINE => Police. They have their head in their asshole and they still can't find shit.
ANDY => Well put. So, what exactly has uncle Terrence been up to lately?
SERAFINE => He's doing a book with Professor Roussel, about medieval chemistry. I was just transcribing his notes onto the computer and - oh shit!
SERAFINE => Salots! Shitfucker!
ANDY =>  What?
SERAFINE => If you leave it for more than a few minutes it locks up. Now I must reboot and type a dozen fucking passwords. He was security crazy.
ANDY => I still can't get over it. The cops said it was a "maniac", but he looked like, I don't know, like he'd gone through a combine harvester or... something.
SERAFINE => They wouldn't let me see him. Family only. I told them, Terry was almost like a father to me, you know?
ANDY => Depends. Was "Terry" a father like Ward Cleaver or a father like Woody Allen?
SERAFINE => You must not have known him very well. He's not like that.
ANDY => Hey, Sorry if I was out of line.
SERAFINE => You were. I have work to do. The publisher wants the transcripts by Monday. Go. Make yourself at home.
ANDY => Fine. My mistake. You know, I'm gonna be a writer myself some day.
SERAFINE => Uh-huh. Good for you.
ANDY => Medusa... What's this? some kind of club?
SERAFINE => It's nothing. A stupid party. Not really a night club, it's, uh...
ANDY => Like an underground club?
SERAFINE => Yes. It's a bad place. Weird people. Strange things go on.
ANDY => And who's Claude?
ANDY => I looked through my uncle's date book. Writer's curiosity.
SERAFINE => Professor Claude Rousel. The one your uncle was working with. He teaches cultural history.
ANDY => In an underground club? I'd like to see that.
SERAFINE => I'm serious. There's nothing for you down there. It's dangerous.
ANDY => Come on. I'm from New York - the "shoot me" state. Don't wait up.
SERAFINE =>  What good can you do? Why are you being so fucking stupid?
ANDY =>  Maybe I didn't know him like you did. But he's my uncle. And I owe it to him to get some answers. It's a quest like, uh, Hemingway, the Old Man and The Sea. Except instead of an old man I'm a young man, and instead of the sea, it's a bunch of tunnels under Paris. And instead of a big fish it's... who knows? That's what I'm going to find out. Au revoir.
SERAFINE => You're a fucking lunatic!
SERAFINE =>  God damned Americans.
ANDY =>  Some party.
ANDY => That's alright. I'll be a cowboy.
ANDY => Alright. Fine...  Ooh. I can feel it tingling.
ANDY => Phew. What's in this stuff, liquid plumber? (he pulls the book out of his pocket and shows her Claude's picture) Do you know this guy? Claude?
WAIF => Ah oui, le professeur. La bas.
ANDY => Uh, lemme get back to ya on that.
CLAUDE =>  ...How ironic. A man who dedicated his life to opening the doors of the mind now lies trapped behind them. Locked behind a door without a key.
ANDY => Excusez moi, I...
CLAUDE => I'm sorry my friend, I'm not signing books right now. There's been a tragedy.
ANDY => I know. I'm Andy McDermott. Terrence's nephew.
CLAUDE => My God, I'm sorry. But how did you find your way down here? Wait, let's go talk...
CLAUDE => It's horrible. Terrence was one of the most brilliant men I've known.
ANDY => Yeah, well, why did he hang out here? The cops said it's dangerous -
CLAUDE => The cops. It's their backward laws that force all this underground in the first place, endangering people whose only crime is pushing the limits of perception, exploring new states of psychic awareness.
ANDY => Psychic awareness. Right.
CLAUDE => You think it's silly. But do you realize that young man is actually in a deep sleep?
ANDY => What?
CLAUDE => He's on a new drug called ZBH, or "Daydream". It allows the user to be fully alert and mobile while he's dreaming. He is literally conscious and unconscious at the same time.
ANDY => Yeah well, that's like really groovy and everything, but who hacked my uncle's legs off?
CLAUDE => Andy...
ANDY => Yeah?
CLAUDE => Terrence and I came down here to do serious work. For centuries these tunnels have been home to subcultures mainstream society would not tolerate.
CLAUDE => These people carry on traditions dating back to pagan times - the ancient quest for expanded consciousness. At the same time they're pioneering a chemical revolution, powerful state-of-the- art compounds... But you know what I mean.... (he gestures to Andy's face paint) A year ago who would have dreamed of topically applied hallucinogens like TMD? Except Terry of course...
ANDY => What!? Hallucinogen? Oh shit...
CLAUDE => You didn't know? But then why did you... well, don't worry. It's relatively mild.
ANDY => Yeah, well if I claw my face off, just pack it in ice, okay? Jesus... the cops were probably right. My uncle was messed up with a bunch of fry brains and they went berserk on him.
CLAUDE => No... We stumbled on something else down here Andy. Something horrible, almost unbelievable. But very real. It's been going on for centuries, though most people wouldn't believe it, or wouldn't want to...
ANDY => Wait a second, are you like the Steven King of France or something...
SERAFINE => Andy!
ANDY => So you came after all. Just in time, it's getting interesting.
SERAFINE => You must get out of here. It's not safe.
ANDY => Not you too -
CLAUDE =>  My God! Serafine's right. It's time to go. We'll talk soon.
SERAFINE => Bon nuit Claude.  Come on.
ANDY => Hey, chill out a second!
ANDY => Alright, hold on. I'm not gonna get dragged around like some kid in a shopping mall. I want you to answer some questions.
SERAFINE => Merde. I knew I shouldn't have come here.
GASTON =>  Serafine, mon cher. I hear your boss looks great in cut-offs.
SERAFINE =>  Get the fuck away from me, Gaston.
GASTON =>  First you tell me where the ADM is, eh?
SERAFINE =>  Fuck you.
ANDY => Well, this explains the two fingers they found in Liberace's asshole.
GASTON => In Paris we have an expression for people like you: Encul d'Americain.
ANDY => Yeah? In New York we got an expression too. Goes like this...
ANDY => Serafine!
ANDY => Whoa. C'mon.
ANDY => Serafine!?
ANDY => Sorry... I, uh, did you see a girl, la femme, um, avec, la dress blanc?
ANDY => Ahh! Son of a bitch!
ANDY => SERAFINE!?
ANDY => Oh shit!
ANDY => Jesus Christ...
ANDY => HELP! OFFICER!
COP =>  Hey! You shouldn't be down there!
ANDY => FOR GOD'S SAKES, LET ME OUT!!
COP =>  You are not allowed down there!
ANDY => GET ME THE FUCK OUT OF HERE!!
COP =>  "Fuck"? You think I don't know this word "fuck"? Is that how you talk to policemen in America?
ANDY =>  FUCK! FUCK! FUCK! FUCK! FUCK!
COP =>  Okay, what the hell are you up to?
ANDY => It bit me! My leg! Jesus, it's down there, shoot it! Shoot it for Christ's sakes!
COP =>  Your passport.
ANDY => There's something down there! A bear or something! A god damn monster! Beau coup teeth! Huge, Grande, with yellow eyes, all this hair, it killed Serafine! My God...
COP => You on drugs? Huh?
ANDY =>  No... I...
COP =>  Stay off the street.
ANDY => Oh god. Je suis seriously messed up...
TERRENCE => Saint Severin...
LEDUC =>  What else did he say?
PEROTIN =>  Yellow eyes... big teeth... (he can barely choke out the words between laughs) Covered with hair! Ha-ha-ha!
LEDUC =>  Okay Perotin. You can go.
LEDUC =>  Well?
MARCEL =>  Okay. So maybe you were right.
LEDUC => Hmmph. At least now there's one person around here who doesn't think I'm crazy.
LEDUC =>  Twelve thirty-six a.m. here. Twelve forty a.m. here. There's two of them. At least.
MARCEL => Merde.
LEDUC =>  Two more nights in this lunar cycle.
MARCEL => Double merde.
LEDUC => You better follow that McDermott kid. He's going to wind up like his uncle if he's not careful.
MARCEL => Right. Little twerp thinks he's Colombo.
LEDUC => And do some research, will you?
MARCEL =>  Saint Severin...
LEDUC => You never heard the story of Saint Severin driving the werewolves from Paris?
MARCEL => You think that's what McDermott was raving about in the ambulance?
LEDUC => What, you think everyone's as ignorant as you?
MARCEL => Pretty much.
MARCEL => Inspector, you're not exactly typical. I mean c'mon...  This thing isn't sitting on a lot of coffee tables.
ANDY => Aoww! Hey! What the hell...?
SERAFINE => Andy! Holy shit!
ANDY => Serafine...?
SERAFINE => Thank God! What a relief! I thought... After you disappeared... I couldn't find you... I thought all sorts of horrible things...
ANDY => Yeah... Ditto. I saw, er, I thought I saw you get munched... like Uncle Terrence...
SERAFINE => What happened? Did you cut yourself?
ANDY => Um... sort of... Maybe... It's all kind of blurry. We met at the club, then... Damn, that was some weird shit.
SERAFINE => That was fucking stupid, going down there. You could have been killed. I tried to warn you, But you don't listen. Just like your uncle.
SERAFINE => You have to be a hero. All Americans think they are cowboys.
ANDY =>  I was an Indian, actually. Man, that damn psycho paint...! If that's supposed to be mild, I don't want to know about medium. (he looks at the woman and smiles, the sun on his face. To himself:) The planet earth. It's good to be back.
SERAFINE => So... you feel okay now?
ANDY => Yeah. Actually, I feel fan-fucking- tastic.
SERAFINE => Fan-fucking-tastic?
ANDY => Hey, what more could I want? I survived my first and last hallucinogenic hellride, and neither of us is dead. I'd say I feel almost as great as you look.
SERAFINE => Hey! Calm down.
ANDY => Come on Serafine. Let's go out. Show me the real Paris, the part that isn't overpriced and overrun with German tourists.
SERAFINE => Go to Jim Morrison's grave at Pere Lachaise. It's overrun with American tourists. I have to work.
ANDY => I know! Let's go hock loogies off the Eiffel Tower!
SERAFINE => Here. You go. "Hock some loogies" for me.
ANDY => What about food? Even beautiful women have to eat. It's true. I read it. Please? A half an hour? (pause. He sees she's tempted) My treat? (she's smiling. He resorts to begging) Pleez! Don't make go out there alone again! I'm begging you!
SERAFINE => Okay. But I'm back in half an hour.
SERAFINE => What about your glasses?
ANDY => It's okay. I can see fine.
SERAFINE => Don't you want to change?
ANDY => Man! Our first date and already you're trying to get me to change! You French women work quick!
ANDY => Now this is Paris!
SERAFINE => Shit! You bought enough pate for a fucking army!
ANDY => So tell me, exactly which truck driver did you study English with?
ANDY => Like I should talk. Monsieur foot-in- the-mouth. I'm really sorry about that whole Woody Allen thing...
SERAFINE => So's Woody Allen. (Andy laughs. She starts uncorking the wine.) No, your uncle really helped me. I was sort of messed up for a while. Wasting my time just partying and... just stupid shit. He kind of woke me up, gave me a job, got me taking classes. (she uncorks the wine and fills their plastic cups) You know, he and Claude, their work is controversial, but they're serious about it. Totally dedicated.
ANDY => That's what counts. If you're not passionate about it, don't waste your time. That's why I quit college... Plus I'm a lazy bastard. (They raise their cups. Andy taps his forehead.) Wait, I know this... A votre sante.
SERAFINE => A la votre.
ANDY => This looks familiar...
SERAFINE => Ahh, Rodin. Mmm! He's the fuc- (she catches herself and laughs) I mean, he's the best. You must go to the Rodin sculpture garden, in the huitieme, it's so beautiful.
ANDY => Yeah, I gotta admit, you French are pretty good at beautiful.
ANDY => I bet you're pretty good at this too.
SERAFINE => What, sculpting?
SERAFINE => Hey, calm down a second...
SERAFINE => What's wrong with you!?
ANDY => What? Aren't I a good kisser? What's the matter?
SERAFINE => God, look at my lipstick. Look, I'm going to run into the bathroom at that cafe. Stay here and watch the stuff, okay?
ANDY => Serafine...
SERAFINE => I'll be right back. Stay put.
ANDY => Fixing your makeup with a phone, huh? Who the fuck are you calling?
SERAFINE => Professor Roussel. There's something wrong with you. I know it.
ANDY => Roussel? You mean Claude? You're calling Dr. Demento so he can come paint my face again? Fuck that.
SERAFINE => Andy, stop! I think he can help you - 
CLAUDE => Allo?
ANDY => What, you think you're gonna catch fucking leprosy from me? Fuck that shit! If I'm not good enough for you I'll find someone else!
SERAFINE => Andy!
CLAUDE =>  Serafine? Is that you? What's going on?
SERAFINE =>  Claude, it's Andy, he's acting really weird, I think something happened last night...
CLAUDE => God, well don't let him go! Catch him!
SERAFINE => Fuck!
CLAUDE => Serafine? Allo?
FRENCH TOUGH => Idiot!
ANDY => Ah, bite me!
ANDY => Ahem. Did you know that, according to the "Let's Go" code of conduct, whenever two Americans meet in Paris, the one with the sexiest smile has to buy dinner?
ANDY => Damn! You win!... Waiter! Garcon!
AMY => Actually, I'm waiting for someone.
ANDY => What a coincidence, I am someone!  Mmm. Calvin Klein's Obsession. Now it's mine too.
ANDY => Hi. Another, bigger bottle for this ravishing blue eyed Goddess and myself. And, avez vous le Steak Tartar?
SERAFINE => Merde! Salots!
SERAFINE => Aaaaah!
AMY => God. How can you eat like that?
ANDY => It's all in the tongue. Another bottle?
AMY => Jean-Luc. You're kinda late sweetie.
JEAN-LUC => I was busy. Is this a friend of yours?
AMY => Well, yeah, kinda', but -
ANDY => We're so much more than friends. We're soul mates, sex slaves, pen pals, the whole nine yards. Well, nine yards is a slight exaggeration, but believe me, for a white boy, I got nothing to be ashamed of.
ANDY => Hey, I'm kidding... It's a joke! Here, maybe if I say it in metric.
JEAN-LUC => Think you're smart, huh?
AMY => Jean-Luc, don't be a jerk.
ANDY => Hey, look man, she -
JEAN-LUC => Shut up. Why are you Americans always so loud?
ANDY => I don't know. Maybe it's so we can drown out the sound of your mother fucking the navy?
AMY => Wow. You know Kung Fu or something?
ANDY =>  Yeah. Apparently.
AMY => Ha ha. You were probably right about his mom.
ANDY => Hope I didn't hurt him too bad.
AMY => Who gives a shit? I've had it up to here with arrogant Frenchmen.
ANDY => Up to there? Really? I bet I could beat that.
AMY => Ha ha! Yeah right, white boy! Ha Ha ha.  I think maybe I drank too much.
ANDY => Ah. The mating call of the blonde. The night is young, the moon is bright, whataya feel like doing tonight?
AMY => I don't know... Surprise me.
AMY => Are you kidding?! I LOVE Jim Morrison!!
AMY => My God! You're an animal!
AMY => Ahh! Jesus! You're burning hot! What the hell -
ANDY => AHHHHHHH!
MARCEL =>  Alright already, you passed the audition for God's sakes.
AMY => Hey, where are you going!?
AMY => Creep.
AMY => I don't know what's wrong with you, man, but I got your pants, so we better talk.
MARCEL => Merde!
AMY =>  He's gone psycho ballistic. This is bad.
AMY => Oh my God...
AMY => Unnnhh...
MARCEL => Merde...
ANDY => Jesus...
ANDY => Hello?
SERAFINE =>  Are you okay?
ANDY => No, I don't think so... I was having a nightmare. Wait a second...
SERAFINE => Where did you go last night? What did you do?
ANDY => I don't... I... I can't remember...
SERAFINE => Listen, I'm coming over. Don't go anywhere. Stay right there.
ANDY => Oh no... no...
LEDUC => Get dressed.
LEDUC => You recognize her?
ANDY => What?!
LEDUC =>  That's the wrong one!
ANDY =>  You, uh, you want to tell me what this is about?
TECHINICAN => Inspector! C'est le voici.
LEDUC => We know you were with her.
ANDY => Oh shit... No...
LEDUC => That's not all... (he reaches for another drawer above Amy's) Marcel - Officer Boulard was following you.
ANDY => Oh no... no....
LEDUC => He was a good man. Now his wife is a widow.
ANDY =>  This is... it's like a sick joke, I -
LEDUC => This is not a joke! Not a dream! These people are dead and -
LEDUC => Merde... Wait here. When I return you tell me about last night, huh?
ANDY => But... I don't remember anything, I swear...
LEDUC =>  I leave these open. Maybe something comes back to you.
AMY => Thanks for the lovely evening, shithead!
ANDY => Aaaaa! Jesus! This isn't happening. I'm still hallucinating. Shit!
AMY => You really know how to show a girl a good time, don't you?
CHIEF =>  Okay. So he's weird. Maybe on drugs. Still, that's not -
LEDUC => I'm telling you. It's not drugs. It's something more. Someth -
CHIEF => Don't give me your black magic bullshit! Seven mutilations in forty eight hours and all you find is a scrawny American boy? Do you have a motive?  Do you have a weapon? Or do you want me to believe he did it with his own two hands?
LEDUC =>  I told you. These murders are not normal.
AMY => Face it boyfriend. This is really happening.
ANDY => No it isn't! You're dead!
MARCEL => I'm afraid she's not so lucky. She's undead. And so am I.
ANDY => Aaaaa!!! Get the fuck away from me!
MARCEL => What are you so damn angry about? Did somebody turn into a wild beast and rip your intestines out? Huh?
AMY => I spent four years on StairMaster for this bod and you rip through it like a pork chop. Thanks.
ANDY => Okay... dead or undead... what do you want from me?
AMY => A-duh... You're a werewolf. And we, as your victims, have to walk the earth until your curse is lifted.
ANDY => Uh huh... And, supposing I believed that, what could I do about it?
AMY/MARCEL =>  Kill yourself.
AMY => It's the only way.
MARCEL => It's not so hard. I used to think about it all the time. Maybe you should meet my wife.
CHIEF => Enough. Cut him loose.
LEDUC => I can't! At midnight tonight, he will kill again. It's crazy!
CHIEF => Are you crazy? We have nothing. Let him go, then watch him. If you're right, you can pick him up at midnight. Or maybe he'll lead you to the others. Just let him go.
LEDUC => You're free to go.
ANDY => Me?
MARCEL => Hanging is nice. Never goes out of style. What about hare-kare - a taste of the Orient? But no! You're in Paris! Try the Guillotine! There's one in the Louvre!
AMY => I'd use pills. They're painless.
MARCEL => Oh give me a break! He could use pills back in America! Why not get a little culture?
ANDY => Look, I didn't mean to hurt anybody... God, I didn't mean to... to...
AMY => Rip my face off? Hey, we all make mistakes. Hell, I didn't mean to sleep with you on the first night, especially without a condom. But I did, and now I'm paying the price.
MARCEL => Let's face it. It's a, how do you say... mother-fucker. But we're all in it together. That's why we're trying to help you.
AMY => Exactly.
MARCEL => Merde! Just missed!
AMY =>  Uhh! Would you die already!
ANDY => Fuck you! If I'm gonna kill myself I'll do it when I'm good and ready! You can go to hell!
MARCEL => No we can't. That's the problem. God knows it would beat hanging around with you!
ANDY => Hey, you can't kick me! You're an apparition!
AMY => What, all of a sudden you got a degree in supernatural law?
MARCEL => Call it the power of suggestion.
RENE =>  You know, in his own way, he's probably happier than any of us.
ANDY => Ha-ha!
AMY => Oh, big man. You can beat up a couple of cadavers. Well let me make something real clear, asshole. If you don't kill yourself, at midnight tonight you're gonna transform and murder innocent people!
MARCEL => What are you going to be, McDermott? A coward and a murderer? Or a man, with guts enough to do the right thing?
ANDY => Alright. Let me write a letter.
MARCEL => Good man. Now can I have my arms back?
TERRENCE'S MACHINE =>  Hey. This is Terrence. Please leave a message at the beep...  In other words, this is Terrence McDermott. Please leave a message. 
ANDY => Hey, Serafine, I hope you're checking these. It's Andy. So I guess you knew what was wrong with me yesterday. Unfortunately it took me until today to realize it, and because of that two people are dead. If you didn't know, well, shit, it's irrelevant now. I know what I have to do, but before I do it I just wanted to say... I don't know what would've happened with us, but I'm really glad I had the chance to know you even if it was only a couple of days and... I don't know... I probably wouldn't have the nerve to say this if I was gonna see you again, but I think if I had the chance to kiss you one more time I would've fallen totally in love with you.
ANDY => Oh well... Bye Serafine.
SERAFINE => Merde!
AMY => Geez, I feel bad for him. Maybe we should've told him abou -
MARCEL => Are you crazy!? You know that's totally impractical. Besides, like the Bible says... (he sticks his finger in her empty eye socket) An eye for an eye...
ANDY => Let's do it.
ANDY => What the hell, lots of my heroes killed themselves. Hemingway, Van Gogh... um... Herve Villachaise...
MARCEL => But this is class kid, all the way. What a way to go.
AMY => You got style, babe. That's why I went for you in the first place.
ANDY => When they ask how I died, just tell 'em... Ei-ffel.
FRANCOIS =>  Should we follow him up?
RENE => Well, he's gotta come down some time. Fuck it, let's grab a bite.
FRANCOIS => Good thinking.
RENE => Vous avez les doughnuts?
ANDY => There's only one thing certain in life - each of us owes God a death.
ANDY => All we can do is make sure it's a good one.
ANDY => Shit. I feel sick.
MARCEL => Don't worry. In a few seconds you won't feel a thing.
ANDY => Puking on yourself in midair is not a good death.
AMY => Look, the more you think about it, the harder it is.
MARCEL => Just like sex with my wife.
AMY => The key is don't look down.
MARCEL => Also like sex with my wife.
AMY =>  Would you shut up?
MARCEL => Tell you what, we'll jump together.
AMY =>  Sure. We wouldn't ask you to do anything we wouldn't do. Now give me your hand... that's it...
AMY/MARCEL => One... two... three... JUMP!
GASTON => You're not getting off so easy.
MARCEL => Merde! I can't believe this!
AMY => You try to be a good sport, and look what happens.
MARCEL'S HEAD => Huh. Galileo was right.
AMY'S HEAD => Who?
GASTON => Where's the ADM? Where did your uncle put it?
ANDY => Man, I don't know what the fuck you're talking about.
GASTON => Bullshit! Your uncle told you!
ANDY => My uncle's in a coma you moron!
GASTON => Before the coma!
ANDY => He didn't tell me anything. All he said was Saint Severin...
GASTON => Saint Severin? The church? So you know all about the ADM! (Andy reacts to the word "church?") Where is it! Tell me! Tell me or else!
ANDY => Or else what? You'll kill me?
GASTON => No. But I'll kill your fucking girlfriend!
ANDY => You'll never get the chance.
ANDY => It was you! You son-of-a-bitch! You got my uncle!
GASTON => Don't be an idiot! I'm not the only one. If I die, Serafine dies!
ANDY => Bullshit! You're bluffing!
GASTON => What, you think Claude hangs out underground cause he likes to dance?
ANDY => Claude...?
GASTON => And you call me a moron...
RENE =>  Oh! You ate the last jelly!
GASTON => The ADM. Let's go.
ANDY => Yeah, okay. Just gimme a minute to freshen up.
TOURISTS => Bravo! Magnifique! Wunderbah!
ANDY => I must be in Paris. Even the werewolves are poseurs.
ANDY => So, if you and the nutty professor are both werewolves, what do you want with drugs? You like seeing lots of pretty colors when you're tearing people's throats out?
GASTON => If you know about the church, why ask such stupid questions?
ANDY => Damn...
GASTON => What's the problem?
ANDY => Hey, I'm new here, what do you want?
GASTON => Fucking cretin...
GASTON => Where is it? Hurry up!
ANDY =>  Okay, okay. I got your magic medicine right here, dogboy. Just -
GASTON => Do you think I'm an idiot?
ANDY =>  Sure. Don't you?
SERAFINE => Looking for this?
ANDY => Hey, hey... shhh. It's okay now... La Femme Nikita strikes again.
SERAFINE => Andy, I thought... I heard your message and... thank God you're alright.
ANDY => I'm not alright. We both know that. The only reason I'm here now is to warn you. You're still in danger. Gaston told me that Claude has got the curse too. He's a werewolf.
SERAFINE => I know. He told me.
ANDY => What?! He told you? When?
CLAUDE => Two weeks ago.
ANDY => You two faced bastard. I knew you were full of shit.
SERAFINE => Andy! No!
ANDY => Serafine! Move! Don't you see, he's just after the drug, that ADM stuff. He's using you to get to it, just like he used Uncle Terrence.
CLAUDE => You're exactly right, Andy. I enlisted both Serafine and your uncle to obtain ADM. And now I'm counting on your assistance too.
ANDY => Why the fuck would I do that?
SERAFINE => Because, Andy. It's a cure.
ANDY => A cure?
CLAUDE => A cure. With ADM we can wipe out lycanthropy, the curse of the werewolf, forever.
ANDY => Is that so? Maybe we should go to Saint Severin church and make sure, huh?
CLAUDE => Ah, you've done your homework... Excellent. Get your coat. Leave the gun with Serafine. She can keep searching. We don't have much time.
SERAFINE => Andy... I should never have let you go underground. I'm sorry...
ANDY =>  I had to be a damn Hemingway hero. Well I'll tell ya, the old man and the sea didn't go through half this shit.
RENE =>  He's going into Saint Severin church with Professor Claude Roussel.
LEDUC =>  Really... Okay, keep checking in.
ANDY => Whoa...
CLAUDE => The panels that concern us are over here. (he directs Andy to a group of panels) I'll translate the Latin.
CLAUDE => "Then Simon did slay the demon spirit, the same as had made him unclean,"
CLAUDE => "and Simon did cut out the heart of the beast which once dead, regained the shape of a man"
CLAUDE => "Simon ate of the heart of the beast and his soul was cleansed."  These pictures are not just myth, Andy. The scholars of the day used them to record facts and enlighten the public. This is the medieval version of a newspaper.
ANDY =>  Yeah, well what if it's the Weekly World News...
AMY => No. It's all true, Andy...
AMY => I mean, if by some miracle you can find the werewolf that bit you, and then manage to eat it's heart, the curse is lifted. I was gonna tell you but Marcel wouldn't let me.
MARCEL => Oh sure, it was all mean old Marcel's idea. Give me a break! We didn't tell you because it's a wild goose chase! Not to mention disgusting. Look...
MARCEL => A little Grey Poupon and then Bon appetite, eh?
CLAUDE =>  I don't believe we've been introduced.
ANDY => What?... Oh, right, you can see these guys too. Jesus... 
AMY =>  Amy. Nice to meet you.
MARCEL => Marcel. (Claude smiles politely, declining Marcel's rotting hand) My wife has all your books.
ANDY => Great. Later on we'll have to get together for cocktails. Right now I kinda have to hurry before I grow a lot of hair and eat people.  Say this heart thing works. What's it got to do with ADM?
CLAUDE => It's chemistry, Andy. Nothing more. Mutated antigens concentrated in the heart of the infector unlock a vaccine- like chain reaction in the infectee. There were not many bio-chemists working in the twelfth century, but with today's technology it's possible to synthesize any chemical imaginable. When I discovered this ancient cure I knew who to go to.
ANDY => Uncle Terrence.
CLAUDE => Yes. I was able to decode the old texts and give Terrence the specifications. It took a lot of trial and error, but finally he got it: Adenine Di-Methyloxide. ADM. I call it ADAM. But just before he was attacked, he hid it...
ANDY => Because Gaston was after it.
CLAUDE => Yes, that sociopath. He's given himself over to the evil of lycanthropy. To him, ADAM is just a threat to the terror he holds over others. To us, it's salvation.
MARCEL => Yeah, well I don't know much about chemistry, but even if this stuff works, you better find it by midnight. Otherwise it's -
ANDY => Yeah, I know. Back to the Eiffel Tower.  And what about you?
CLAUDE => Believe me, I won't go through another night of that hell. I have my contingency plan right here.
CLAUDE => Sodium cyanide.
ANDY => Eight o'clock. Shit. You'd think my uncle would have left a clue, a note, something...
CLAUDE => That's what Serafine is searching for. Without much luck, I'm afraid. If only we could speak with him. But alas, he's off in another realm, close to death.
MARCEL => Andy, please. Don't smile like that. You're scaring me.
SERAFINE => What makes you so sure this will work?
ANDY => I told you. He already tried to contact me once. If you saw his face... He was desperate to tell me something. I owe him this.
SERAFINE => I don't know...
ANDY => Listen, either he wastes away as a pathetic vegetable or he can give what's left of his life to save hundreds of potential victims. He's a McDermott. I know what his choice would be.
SERAFINE => I suppose you're right. But I still don't like it.
ANDY => Fine. You don't have to watch. Stay out here and stand guard.
ANDY => Hey. We meet again... Look, I know you understand what I'm about to do here. I think. But I hope you forgive me anyway.
ANDY => So. You moved...
ANDY => You don't look happy... Um, I don't usually go in for this stuff, but... (He crosses himself, and says a silent prayer) Amen.
ANDY => Uncle Terrence? Can you hear me?
NURSE => Chambre 411. Code bleu! Code bleu!
ANDY => Come on... Skip the undead orientation and get down here.
SERAFINE => They're coming!
ANDY => Shit. What have I done?  Stall them! I'll meet you out back.
SERAFINE =>  Stay away from him! You butchers! Haven't you done enough already!
ANDY => Damn it!!
TERRENCE => Whoa! What an outrageous nightmare!
ANDY => Uncle Terrence?
TERRENCE => Andy? Andy is that you?
ANDY => Yeah. Look, uncle Terrence -
TERRENCE => Andy, I have to tell you about the dream I had - or that I'm still having - it feels like a systemic, physio- tropic reaction to some drug, maybe a triptamine or phenethylamine derivative. But it is hyper-real. I'd swear my legs had been cut off or... wait a second... I'm getting a strange meta-physical buzz. Shit. I'm, uh, dead, aren't I?
ANDY => Sort of...
TERRENCE => Undead. Right. Sort of an ectocosmic manifestation. What a pisser. Tell you one thing though, Timothy Leary will be jealous as hell.
ANDY => Great, but listen, I need to know where you hid the ADM?
TERRENCE => The ADM! Be careful, Andy. It's very powerful. How do you know about it?
ANDY => I went to St. Severin church. (Terrence reacts "I see...") Now look -
TERRENCE => Oh shit! No! Andy, don't let them take me back there!
ANDY => The ADM! Quickly! Where is it?!
ANDY => Where is it! Please!
TERRENCE => AHHH!! The wine cellar!! In a bottle of Chateau Margaux. A metal cylinder... Don't... Don't - AAAAH!
TERRENCE => Lies! All lies! Ahhhh!!!
ANDY => I saw him. Just before those bastards zapped him back. The ADM is in the wine cellar, in a bottle of Chateau Margaux.
SERAFINE => I didn't know he had a wine cellar.
ANDY => Guess that's why he hid it there. Let's go.
SERAFINE => Oh shit! He must have heard us.
ANDY => Dammit! C'mon!
SERAFINE => That bastard! Fuck!
ANDY => Sorry... I'll bring it back.
SERAFINE => Oh merde!
SERAFINE => Are you crazy!?
ANDY => Before Hemingway, there was Starsky and Hutch.
COP =>  Pull over! Now!
ANDY => Shit!
FIRST COP =>  Hands in the air! Now!
SECOND COP =>  Hot shot huh? You know how many officers die in high speed chases?
SERAFINE =>  Moron! The guy ahead of us has a gun! He's the one you should stop!
SECOND COP => Shut up! I don't need you to tell me my job. It's always "the other guy"!
SERAFINE => He's going to kill people you ignorant shithead!
SECOND COP => Okay! That's it! You're under arrest! Maybe you'll learn some respect in jail!
FIRST COP => Really?
FIRST COP =>  You can go.
SECOND COP =>  WHAT!?
FIRST COP =>  Drive safely.
ANDY => Merci.
LEDUC =>  Hello.  I'll meet you there in ten minutes.
LEDUC =>  Thank God for Saint Severin.
SERAFINE => Wait a second...
SERAFINE => Dirty bastard...
GASTON => That's far enough!
GASTON =>  Another step and he's dead!
ANDY => Go ahead Serafine. Blow him away.
CLAUDE => Drop the gun!
SERAFINE =>  You heard him. Do it!
CLAUDE => I said drop the gun.
ANDY => You bastard! God! I should've known. You wanted the cure all for yourself!
GASTON => Cure!? Ha-ha-ha!
CLAUDE => No, it's no cure. It's something much more interesting.
SERAFINE => You fucking liar!
CLAUDE =>  Oh, did I hurt the little girl's feelings? Well excusez moi... I confess my desire for ADM is quite "intense". So I deceived you and our poor friend Terry - a competent technician, but let's face it, a bit naive. "The great cure for lycanthropy!" Hmph. He didn't have the vision to grasp the potential of ADAM, until it was too late. And even then, he came rushing down to tell me, as if I would be just as shocked! Ha.
CLAUDE =>  Oh this? Rolaids. I had a midnight snack that... disagreed with me.
SERAFINE => Fucking traitor!
ANDY => Wait a second...
GASTON => You want to be cured?
ANDY => What the fuck!? You too!?
SERAFINE =>  I... I didn't think you would... I'm sorry... I believed that son-of-a- bitch...
CLAUDE => Shut up, you foul mouthed little cunt. I don't have time for your histrionics.
GASTON => Give me the ADM old man.
CLAUDE => Oh for Christ's sakes Gaston. Can't you rise above the level of common thug just this once?
GASTON => Give it to me!
CLAUDE => Don't be an idiot. There are certain procedures one must -
GASTON => NOW!
CLAUDE => Very well then...
ANDY => Ha. Some wonder drug...
GASTON => Why isn't it doing anything!?
CLAUDE => I told you. It's not ready.
COPS =>  Freeze! Drop your weapons! Hands up!
CLAUDE =>  Thank God! These hoodlums tried to rob me!
LEDUC =>  Put up your hands.
CLAUDE =>  But surely -
LEDUC =>  Now!
CLAUDE =>  What's the charge?
LEDUC =>  There is no charge.  Everybody comes in for a few questions. Everything checks out, you will go free. After midnight.
LEDUC =>  Godard is waiting for you at Rocherout jail. Hurry... And don't stop for anything. Good luck.
LEDUC => I want four separate maximum security cells ready. Get video cameras, photographers, and doctors.
GASTON => Nothing's happening!
ANDY => Looks like he lied to you too.
CLAUDE =>  Relax my friend. It's still not ready.
ANDY => Now I remember why I didn't want to come to Paris. Everyone you meet is a goddam werewolf!
SERAFINE => I hope they fucking fry us all.
ANDY => Yeah. French fries...
GASTON => Yes! Yes! Ha! Haha hahaha...
PARTNER => Aaooooo!!! Heh heh heh.
ANDY => It killed him... You coulda just used Draino. It's cheaper.
CLAUDE => I told him it wasn't ready...
CLAUDE => Now it's ready.
CLAUDE => What is the curse of the werewolf? I'll tell you. The curse is to possess such awesome power and yet be completely unconscious of it. It may as well belong to someone else. But it wasn't always that way. A thousand years ago the Gauls had a drug powerful enough to unlock the door to lycanthropic consciousness, to full control. It came from moonsbreath. A small white flower once found in the hills of this region, until the thick headed crusade by our famous Saint Severin eradicated it for all eternity. But now, thanks to ADAM, the "curse" is over...
SERAFINE =>  Holy mother of God...
ANDY => Fuck me...
CLAUDE => All my life I've worked to unlock the power of the unconscious mind. Well this is it. This is power!
ANDY => You sure it's not just 'coz you jerk off too much?
CLAUDE => Don't you see what this means? I've broken through! I'm in total control! Not the moon! I can do whatever the fuck I want!
COP =>  Hey! What's going on in -
CLAUDE =>  Don't you know... the wolf... is a protected... species!?
ANDY => I need your help. Come on.
CLAUDE => Wait!
LEDUC => Allo! Jean-Louis! Respond! Allo!
PARTNER => Inspector...
LEDUC => Merde... merde, merde, merde.
ANDY => Serafine?
ANDY => Get out of here! Go on! Move it!
ANDY => Serafine... Get up, come on...
SERAFINE =>  Andy?... What? What is it? (she sits up, her head clearing) Andy... are you okay?
ANDY => It was you... That night in the tunnels. You. You did this to me.
SERAFINE => No I.... Andy, you can't be sure.
ANDY => That's the scar where I stabbed you! Oh God... You deliberately took me down there so you could... God, I can't believe it!
SERAFINE => You made me go there. I tried to stop you! You wouldn't listen!
ANDY => What was I? Your idea of a fuckin' hors d'oeuvre? Huh?
SERAFINE => Shut up! You fucking shut up! What do you want? Huh? What the hell do you want?
SERAFINE => Here! Come on! Do it! Go ahead.
ANDY => What...?
SERAFINE => You know what. Kill me. Cut out my fucking heart. Go on! Do it!
ANDY => You're crazy.
ANDY => This is all crazy!
SERAFINE => The drug was a lie, but the legend in the church is true. Ask the undead.
SERAFINE => We don't both have to die.
ANDY =>  I couldn't do it. Not to you.
SERAFINE => I can't go through another night. I won't.
ANDY => I know... I'm already burning up... Look, I'm not going to go through this another night either. But we still have some time to get Claude. He'll just kill more people, and spread the curse.
SERAFINE => We can't stop him. Not now. Handcuffed, with no kind of weapons. Please Andy...
ANDY => No. We have to try. We'll figure something out. And if midnight comes before we can get to him, well, then we go together. Deal? (he extends a cuffed hand) Shake a paw?
SERAFINE => I know where he'll go.
ANDY => Where?
SERAFINE => Somewhere where there are no police, and plenty to eat.
NAPIER =>  Poor Bazin and Racine. At least they brought those monsters down with them.
LEDUC =>  Impossible...  Get headquarters on the radio.
NAPIER => Right away sir.
HIPSTER GUY => Serafine, mon belle! Ca va?
ANDY => This could be fun.
ANDY => I got something you want. Follow me.
SKINHEAD => What do you got, pervert?
ANDY => I got Hitler's dick in a jar. And the funny thing is it's still in Goerring's mouth.
ANDY => Didn't even have to ask.
SERAFINE =>  All your weapons, on the floor! Now!
ANDY => Neo-Nazis. Ya gotta love 'em.  Merci beau coup, monsieurs.
GIRL =>  Ahhhhhhhh! A monster! My God! It got my boyfriend! Noooooo!
SERAFINE => Ou!? Ou est le monstre!?
GIRL => Ahhhh! Let me go! Let me gooooo!!
ANDY =>  Ou est le monstre?
GIRL =>  Down the stairs.
ANDY => Merci.
SERAFINE => No wonder he let her go.
ANDY => Really.
SERAFINE => Her boyfriend.
ANDY => He's alive. C'mon.
ANDY => God. I can't believe it.
SERAFINE => What?
ANDY =>  It's making me hungry.
ANDY => What does it say?
SERAFINE =>  "Stop! Beyond this passage lie the catacombs of Paris: the exclusive domain of the dead."
ANDY => We'll say we're with him.
ANDY => Whoa...
SERAFINE => After the revolution, the Paris cemeteries overflowed. They dug up all the old bodies and brought them here. Seven million people. Mostly very poor.
ANDY => Pretty stylish digs for a bunch of paupers.
SERAFINE => Well, they are French.
ANDY => Right.
ANDY => These tunnels must loop around and connect.
SERAFINE => Let's go from both ends. We'll cut him off.
ANDY => Okay. Be careful.
SERAFINE => You too.
NAPIER =>  It's headquarters sir. They got a report.
LEDUC =>  What've you got?
DESK OFFICER => Just a crazy call from a girl, probably fucked up on drugs. I wouldn't bother you but you said call with anything unusual.
LEDUC => What did she say?
DESK OFFICER => Something about a monster, underground, in the catacombs under Place Denfert.
LEDUC => I need two tactical assault squads at Place Denfert immediately. You can tell the commissioner it's a code red.
DESK OFFICER => But Inspector, this girl, I wouldn't call her reliable.
LEDUC => Now!
DESK OFFICER => Yes sir.
TERRENCE => Don't do it, Andy. Fight it with everything you've got.
ANDY => Uncle Terrence, you're...
TERRENCE => Yeah, I finally "checked out", thank God. But there's a bit of unfinished business.
ANDY => Claude.
TERRENCE => I never thought I'd ask this of anyone, Andy, but do me a favor and kill the evil son-of-a-bitch, will you?
ANDY => C'mon you mother...
ANDY => No! Oh God!
ANDY => Oh God. Shit...
SERAFINE => Andy...
SERAFINE => Do it.
ANDY => No. It's over.
TERRENCE => Don't, Andy. Stop Claude.
MARCEL => Either way works for us...
AMY => But you better hurry.
CLAUDE => You can't turn back Andy.
CLAUDE => "Man is something to be surpassed! A rope, stretched over the abyss between the animal and the Superman". Neitzche was right, Andy. And now, I have crossed that abyss. I am no longer man OR beast, but man AND beast. ADAM has lived up to its name. I am the first new man, and my God it is FUCKING MAGNIFICENT! You're already half way there Andy. Feel the power in your veins. With ADAM, you could harness it. Master it. Let it transform you into something more glorious than your wildest dreams!
SERAFINE => Don't let me die for nothing...
TERRENCE => Andy!
CLAUDE => The choice is yours Andy: deny your own blood, die an unfulfilled child, or face the challenge of mind and body united at last. Which will it be?
CLAUDE => Don't be confused by old beliefs. This is beyond mere words like good or evil. You have to feel it!
ANDY => Feel this.
CLAUDE => Stupid boy...
VOICE =>  STOP WHERE YOU ARE! HANDS UP!
COP =>  It's you. You should be dead in that wreck with Bazin and Racine!
ANDY => Shhh! Be quiet, man! We're not alone -
COP => Shut up! Save your stories. The only thing I want to hear is you begging for your life. I want to see you suffer, like they did. (he sees Andy's look of terror) Haha! You're scared now, eh? Come on. Where's the scary monster now huh? Ha ha... We'll see who -
COP =>  My God!
LEDUC =>  What have you got?
COP =>  It's the girl. Someone cut out her heart.
LEDUC =>  Good.
ANDY =>  Just throw a strike...
ANDY => Shit!
ANDY => Ahh! Son of a bitch!
LEDUC =>  Let's go.
CLAUDE => You have no advantage, Andy! My body has no limits!
CLAUDE => So this is how you choose to die. Hiding like a scared rabbit. Just praying I don't find you...
CLAUDE => Well I assure you, your nervous sweat glands will give you away soon enough my trembling little rabbit.
CLAUDE => AHHHH! IT'S FUCKING GLORIOUS! AAAARRGGGHHH!!
ANDY =>  C'mon already...
CLAUDE/BEAST => RRAAAAAARRRRRRGGG!!
ANDY =>  Now.
ANDY => HEY YOU DIRTY EVIL FUCK! C'MON AND GET ME! I DARE YOUR UGLY ASS!
ANDY => Yes!
LEDUC =>  I always wanted to do that. I saw it in a movie.
ANDY => What about me?
LEDUC => My men think you died and floated away in the Seine. If I wanted to, I could let them believe that.  But that would be illegal...
PROSECUTOR => You intend us to believe that you committed these murders because the moon was full and you were somehow magically transformed into a huge powerful beast with an insatiable appetite for human flesh, is that right?
ANDY => You don't understand!
PROSECUTOR => Oh? So I don't understand? You think it's me who has a hard time coming to grips with reality?
PROSECUTOR => You think I'm the one who needs my head examined? I don't understand? Well, Mr. McDermott, enlighten me.
PROSECUTOR => Good God!!! Aaaaaaaa!!!
STEWARDESS => You were screaming in your sleep, sir. Are you okay?
ANDY => Yeah. It was just, um... something I ate.
