MR. BOBINSKY => Dras, dva, tri, chetyri. Dras, dva, tri, chetyri. Dras, dva, tri ...
MR. BOBINSKY => Mer-sa-vich!
MOVER 2 => We're here. Time to muscle up.
CORALINE => Hello?...   Who's there?
CORALINE => You scared me to death, you mangy thing!
CORALINE => I'm just looking for an old well. Know it?
CORALINE => Not talking, huh?
CORALINE => Magic dowser, magic dowser: show... me... the well!
CORALINE => 
WYBIE => Ow!
CORALINE => And I DON'T LIKE BEING STALKED, not by
WYBIE => He's not really my cat; he's kinda feral you know, wild? Of course, I do feed him every night and sometimes he'll come in my window `n bring me little dead things.
WYBIE => Huh?
CORALINE => MICHIGAN? And if I'm a "water witch",
THEN-- =>  --where's the secret WELL?
WYBIE => You stomp too hard and you'll fall in it!
WYBIE => See? Supposed to be so deep if you fell to the bottom and looked up, you'd see a sky full of stars in the middle of the day.
WYBIE => Surprised she let you move in...
WYBIE => ... my Gramma. She owns the "Pink Palace"  Won't rent to people with kids.
CORALINE => What do you mean?
WYBIE =>  Uh... I'm not supposed to talk about it.
WYBIE => I'm Wybie, Wybie Lovat.
WYBIE => Short for Wyborne. Not my idea, of course. What'd you get saddled with?
CORALINE => I wasn't saddled with anything. It's Coraline.
WYBIE => Caroline what?
CORALINE => Coraline. Coraline Jones.
WYBIE =>  Hmmm... It's not real scientific, but I heard an ordinary name, like Caroline --
WYBIE => -- can lead people to have ordinary expectations about a person--
WYBIE'S GRANDMOTHER =>  Wyborne!
CORALINE => I think I heard someone calling you, Wyborne.
WYBIE => What? I didn't hear anything--
CORALINE => Oh, I definitely heard someone, Why-were- you-born.
WYBIE'S GRANDMOTHER => Wyborne!
WYBIE =>  Grandma!
WYBIE => Heh. Well, great to meet a Michigan water witch.
WYBIE => But I'd wear gloves next time.
WYBIE => `Cause that dowsing rod of yours? Uh, it's poison oak.
CORALINE => Ehh!!
CORALINE => I almost fell down a well yesterday, Mom.
MEL =>  Uh huh.
CORALINE => I would have died.
MEL =>  That's nice.
CORALINE => Hmmm. So can I go out? I think it's perfect weather for gardening.
MEL => No, Coraline. Rain makes mud. Mud makes a mess.
CORALINE => But Mom, I want stuff growing when my friends come to visit. Isn't that why we moved here?
MEL => Something like that. But then we had the accident.
CORALINE => Wasn't my fault you hit that truck.
MEL => I never said it was.
MEL => Coraline, I don't have time for you right now. And you still have unpacking to do. Lots of unpacking.
CORALINE => That sounds exciting.
Mel => Oh - some kid left this on the front porch.
WYBIE => Hey Jonesy, look what I found in Gramma's trunk. Look familiar? Wybie.
CORALINE =>  Huh... a little me? That's weird.
MEL => What's his name, anyway?
CORALINE => Wybie. And I'm way too old for dolls.
CORALINE => Hey Dad, how's the writing going?... Dad?
CHARLIE => Hello, Coraline...  And... Coraline doll?...
CORALINE => D'you know where the garden tools are?
CHARLIE => It's pouring out there, isn't it.
CORALINE => Humph, it's just raining.
CHARLIE => What'd the boss say?
CHARLIE => Then you won't need the tools.
CHARLIE => Uhhh, you know, this house is a hundred and fifty years old.
CORALINE => So?
CHARLIE => So explore it!
CHARLIE => Go out and ... count all the doors and windows and write that down. List everything blue!
CORALINE => Ewww!
CORALINE => Ahh!!
CHARLIE => No, no, no, no, no; GAAAA--!
CORALINE => One boring blue boy in a painfully boring painting ... four incredibly boring windows ... and no... more... doors...
CORALINE => All right, little me, where are you hiding?
CORALINE => Huh?
CORALINE => Hey Mom...
CORALINE => Where does this door go?
MEL => I'm really, really busy!
CORALINE => I think it's locked.
CORALINE => Pleeeeeeeeease!
MEL => Uhhh...
MEL => Will you stop pestering me if I do this for you?
MEL => Fine.
CORALINE => Bricks? I don't get it.
MEL => They must have closed this off when they divided up the house.
CORALINE => You're kidding? And why is the door so small?
MEL => We made a deal. ZIP IT!
CORALINE => You didn't lock it.
MEL => AaaaaH!!!
CHARLIE => Oh, my twitchy witchy girl,
CHARLIE => I think you are so nice, I give you bowls of porridge And I give you bowls of ice --
CHARLIE =>  -- cream!
CORALINE => Why don't you ever cook, Mom?
MEL => Coraline, we've been through this before: your Dad cooks, I clean, and you stay out of the way.
MEL => I swear I'll go food shopping soon as we finish the catalog.  Try some of the chard, you need a vegetable.
CORALINE => Looks more like slime to me.
CHARLIE => Well, it's slime or bedtime fusspot -- now what's it going to be?
CORALINE => Think they're trying to poison me?
CORALINE => Don't forget about me, guys. Okay?
CORALINE => Good-night...little me.
CORALINE => Whoa...
CORALINE => Huh?
CORALINE => MMMMM, something smells good.
CORALINE => Mom?! What are you doing here in the middle of the night?
OTHER MOTHER => You're just in time for supper, dear!
CORALINE => You're not my mother.
CORALINE => My mother doesn't have b-b-buh...
OTHER MOTHER => B-b-b-buttons? Do you like them?
OTHER MOTHER => I'm your Other Mother, silly. Now go tell your Other Father that supper's ready.
OTHER MOTHER => Well, go on. He's in his study.
CORALINE => Hello?
OTHER FATHER => Hello, Coraline. Want to hear my new song?
CORALINE => My father can't play piano.
OTHER FATHER => No need to ... this piano plays ME!
OTHER FATHER => Making up a song about Coraline. She's a peach, she's a doll, she's a pal of mine. She's as cute as a button in the eyes of everyone who ever laid their eyes on Cor- a-line.
OTHER FATHER => When she comes around exploring Mom and I will never ever make it boring our eyes will be on Coraline.
CORALINE => I, uh  sorry  but she said to tell you the food's ready.
OTHER FATHER => Mmmmm! Who's starving? Raise your hand.
OTHER FATHER => We give our thanks and ask to bless, Our Mother's golden chicken breast!
CORALINE => Mmmm, this chicken is good.
OTHER MOTHER => Hungry, aren't you.
CORALINE =>  D'you have any gravy?
OTHER MOTHER => Well, here comes the gravy train! Choo- choo!
OTHER MOTHER => Another roll, sweet peas? Corn on the cob?
CORALINE =>  I'm real thirsty.
OTHER MOTHER => Of course! Any requests?
CORALINE => Mango milk shake?
CORALINE => Home?
OTHER MOTHER => We've been waiting for you, Coraline.
CORALINE => For me?
OTHER FATHER => Yep. Wasn't the same here without you, kiddo.
CORALINE => I didn't know I had an Other Mother.
OTHER MOTHER => Of course you do. Everyone does.
CORALINE => Really?
OTHER MOTHER => Uh huh, and soon as you're through eating, I thought we'd play a game.
OTHER MOTHER => Perfect! Hide and seek in the rain.
CORALINE => What rain?
CORALINE => Huh, what about the mud?
OTHER FATHER => We love mud here!
OTHER MOTHER => Mud facials, mud baths, mud pies -- it's great for poison oak.
CORALINE => I, I'd love to play, but ... I better get home to my other mother.
OTHER MOTHER => But I'm your other mother.
OTHER MOTHER => Of course, sweetheart, it's all made up.
CORALINE =>  But ...
OTHER FATHER => Come along, sleepyhead.
CORALINE => Wow.
DRAGONFLIES => Hello Coraline, hello, hello!
TOY SQUID => What's shakin', baby?
CORALINE => Hello.
CORALINE => Kripes a-mighty, how are my best trolls? I can't wait till summer. You're both comin', right?
CORALINE => Oh, the mud...
CORALINE => It was incredibly real, Mom! Only you weren't really you; you were my other mother.
CORALINE => You were in the dream too, Dad. You had wild-looking pajamas and orange monkey slippers.
CHARLIE =>  Orange? My monkey slippers are blue.
CHARLIE => Because I have a terrible case of writer's rash. On my---.
MEL => If the real Charlie Jones wants his pages edited, he'd better wrap them up ASAP.
MEL => Coraline, why don't you go visit downstairs? I bet those "actresses" would love to hear your dream.
CORALINE => Miss Spink and Forcible? But you said they're dingbats.
CORALINE => Bo-bin-sky...Bo-bin-sky....Bo-bin-sky...
CORALINE => Ohh, Poo-eeeee!
CORALINE => H-hello?...
CORALINE => I think our mail got mixed up.    Should I leave it outside or...
CORALINE => Hmmm...
shut. => The Russian giant, dressed in a sleeveless T-shirt and shorts, pulls a RAW BEET from his pants. He's not happy.
CORALINE => Huh?
MR. BOBINSKY => New "cheese" samples.
MR. BOBINSKY => Very clever, using this "mix up" to sneak my home and peek at meeshkas
CORALINE => Meeshkas?
MR. BOBINSKY => The Mice!
CORALINE => Oh, sorry. I'm Coraline Jones.
MR. BOBINSKY => Ha! You see, Caroline, the problem is my new songs go oompah oompah. But the jumping mice play only toodle toot, like that. Is nice, but not so much amazing? So now--  --I switch to stronger cheese, and soon
MR. BOBINSKY => Here, have beet. Make you strong.  Daas vee DAAN ya, Caroline.
CORALINE => Cor-a-line.
CORALINE =>  Oompah oompah, toodle toot, toodle toot.
CORALINE => No!!!
MR. BOBINSKY => The mice...asked me to give you message.
CORALINE => The...jumping mice?
MR. BOBINSKY => They are saying: do not go through leetle door. Do you know such a thing?
CORALINE => The one behind the wall paper? But... it's all bricked up.
MR. BOBINSKY => Bah. So sorry, is nothing. Sometimes the mice are leetle...
MR. BOBINSKY => ...mixed up, hmmm? They even get your name wrong, you know. They call you Coraline instead of Caroline, not Caroline at all.
MR. BOBINSKY => Maybe I work them too hard...
CORALINE => Still Coraline, Miss Spink.
MISS SPINK =>  Miriam, put the kettle on!
MISS FORCIBLE => April, I think you're being followed.
MISS SPINK => It's the new neighbor, Miriam - Caroline? She'll be having the Oolong tea.
MISS FORCIBLE => No, no, no, no. I'm sure she'd prefer Jasmine.
MISS SPINK => No, Oolong.
MISS FORCIBLE => Ah, Jasmine it is, then.
MISS SPINK => Come on, boys!
MISS SPINK => Now, there's Hamish the third, the fourth, the eighth, the ninth. Angus the second, the fifth, the..
MISS FORCIBLE => Oh go on, have one  it's hand-pulled taffy from Brighton  best in the world.
MISS SPINK => ...seventh, the third, the ninth, yes, the fourthI'm right; and Jock Junior, Jock senior, Jock the third, the fourth...
MISS SPINK => ...oh, and that's Jock's 2nd cousin, twice removed.
MISS SPINK => I'll read them, if you like.
CORALINE => Read what?
MISS SPINK => Oh, your tea leaves, dear. They'll tell me your future. Drink up then, go on.
MISS SPINK => No, not all of it, not all of it. That's right, now hand it over.
MISS SPINK => Oh... Caroline, Caroline, Caroline; you are in terrible danger.
MISS FORCIBLE => Oh, give me that cup, April, your eyes are going.
MISS SPINK => My eyes! You're blind as a bat!
MISS FORCIBLE => Oh, now, ummm... not to worry, child, it's good news: there's a tall, handsome beast in your future.
CORALINE => A what?
MISS SPINK => Miriam, oh really, you're holding it wrong.
MISS SPINK => See? Danger!
CORALINE => What do you see?
MISS FORCIBLE => I see a giraffe.
MISS SPINK => Giraffes don't just fall from the sky, Miriam.
MISS SPINK => Oh!
MISS FORCIBLE => Oh, lord!
CORALINE => Well, what should I do?
MISS SPINK => Never wear green in your dressing room.
MISS FORCIBLE => Acquire a very tall step ladder.
MISS SPINK => And be very, very careful. Now, was there something you came to tell us?
CORALINE => No, I guess not. Thanks for the tea, though.
MISS FORCIBLE => Toodle-oo.
MISS SPINK => Cheery-bye.
MISS SPINK => Do you have any nice Queens for mummy?
CORALINE =>  Danger?
WYBIE => Owwwwwwww!
CORALINE => Great, the village stalker.
WYBIE => Ow. I - I wasn't stalking you. We're hunting banana slugs.
CORALINE => What d'ya mean, "we?"
CORALINE => Ha! Your cat's not wild, he's a wuss- puss!
WYBIE => What? He hates to get his feet wet. Geez.
CORALINE => So... that doll. Did you make it look like me?
WYBIE => Oh no; I found it that way. It's older than Gramma -- old as this house prob'ly.
CORALINE =>  C'mom - blue hair, my swampers and raincoat?
WYBIE => Dang, check out Slugzilla!
WYBIE => Huh?
CORALINE => I meant my parents; they don't listen to me either.
WYBIE => Uh huh... You mind?
CORALINE => Ew!
WYBIE => You know, I've never been inside the Pink Palace.
WYBIE => Grandma would kill me. Thinks it's dangerous or something.
CORALINE => Dangerous?
WYBIE => Well... she had a twin sister.
CORALINE => So?
WYBIE . => When they were kids, Grandma's sister disappeared.
CORALINE => Well, what do you think?
WYBIE => Uhhh, I-I don't know.
WYBIE => Maybe she just ran away?
WYBIE'S GRANDMOTHER => Wyborne!
WYBIE => Look, I gotta go.
CORALINE => Wait a minute!
OTHER MOTHER => Welcome back, darling.
CORALINE => Hi.
OTHER MOTHER => So thoughtful of you to send this nice cheddar, Coraline.
CORALINE => Cheddar?... Oh, the mice bait...
OTHER MOTHER => Would you go fetch your father?
OTHER MOTHER => Bet he's hungry as a pumpkin by now!
CORALINE => You mean my Other Father?
OTHER MOTHER => Your better father, dear.   He's out in the garden.
CORALINE. => But my parents don't have time to garden.
CORALINE => Mmmmmm!
OTHER MOTHER => Go on...
OTHER FATHER => Hey!!!
CORALINE => I love your garden!
OTHER FATHER => Our garden, Coraline!
OTHER FATHER => Oops, daughter in distress!
OTHER FATHER => Tickle no more, you dragon snappers!
CORALINE => Well, she says it's time for dinner ... breakfast ... food?
OTHER FATHER => Hop on, kiddo, I want to show you something!
CORALINE => I can't believe you did this!
OTHER FATHER => Mother said you'd like it! Boy she knows you like the back of her hand.
CORALINE => Mmmm...so good!
OTHER FATHER => I love dinner, breakfast food.
OTHER MOTHER => Coraline, Mr. Bobinsky has invited you to come see the Jumping Mice perform after dinner.
CORALINE => Really. That know-it-all Wybie said it was all in Mr. B's head, I knew he was wrong.
OTHER FATHER => Well, everything's right in this world, Kiddo.
OTHER MOTHER => Your father and I will clean up while you and your friend head upstairs.
CORALINE => My friend?
CORALINE => Great... another Wybie. Hello, Why-were- you-born.
CORALINE => Hello?
OTHER MOTHER => I thought you'd like him more, if he spoke a little less.  So I fixed him.
CORALINE => So he can't talk at all?
OTHER MOTHER => Nope.
CORALINE => Hmm, I like it.
CORALINE => You're awful cheerful, considering you can't say anything.
CORALINE => Uh...It didn't hurt, did it, when she...
CORALINE => Whoa... cool!
CORALINE => Look at you!
CORALINE => It's wonderful, Wybie!
CORALINE => Wow!
CORALINE => Yah! Whooo-oooh! That was great!
CORALINE => We loved it, Mr. B. It was ... so ... so--
CORALINE => A-mazing!
CORALINE => Ughhh.
CORALINE . => ... there were garden squash like balloon animals AND snap dragons.
CORALINE => Oh, and upstairs I saw a real mouse circus, not pretend like the crazy man's in our house.
CHARLIE => You sure you won't come?
MEL =>  Don't fret, Charlie, they'll love the new catalog. At least, they'll love my chapters.
MEL => I did not call him crazy, Coraline.   He's drunk.
CHARLIE => Well, I guess I'll see you around, you dizzy dreamer.
CORALINE => Da-ad! I'm not five anymore.
YOUNG RASCAL => My kingdom for a hooooooorse!!!!
MEL => Put them back.
CORALINE => But Mom, the whole school's gonna wear boring gray clothes. No one will have these.
MEL => Put them back.
CORALINE => My other mother would get them.
MEL => Maybe she should buy all your clothes.
CORALINE => So what do you think's in the other apartment?
MEL => I don't know. Not a family of Jones imposters.
CORALINE => Then why'd you lock the door?
MEL =>  Oh, I found some rat crap and... I thought you'd feel ... safer.
CORALINE => They're jumping-mice, Mom! And the dreams aren't dangerous; they're the most fun I've had since we've moved here.
MEL => Your school might be fun.
CORALINE => With those stupid uniforms?   Right.
MEL => Had to give it a try.
MEL => How do you feel about a mustard-ketchup- salsa wrap for lunch?
CORALINE => Are you kidding me?
MEL => Mmm... Had to go food shopping anyway. Dad's planning something special.
CORALINE => Gross-gusting.
CORALINE => Oh, like the gloves?
MEL => Look, Coraline... if things go well today, I promise I'll make it up.
CORALINE => That's what you always say.
MEL => Won't be long.
OTHER MOTHER => Dearest Coraline,
CORALINE => Hmmm... Wybie's got a cat like you at home. Not the quiet Wybie; the one that talks too much. You must be the Other Cat.
CAT => No. I'm not the other anything. I'm me.
CORALINE => Um... I can see you don't have button eyes. But if you're the same cat, how can you talk?
CAT => I just can.
CORALINE => Cats don't talk at home.
CAT => No?
CORALINE => Nope.
CORALINE => Come back. Please? I... I'm sorry I called you that, I really am.
CORALINE => How'd you get here?
CAT => I've been coming here for a while.
CAT => It's a game we play. She...  ...hates cats and tries to keep me out. But she can't, of course.
CAT => I come and go as I please.
CORALINE => What do you mean? She's amazing!
CAT => You probably think this world is a dream come true. But you're wrong. The Other Wybie told me so.
CORALINE => That's nonsense. He can't talk.
CAT => Perhaps not to you. We cats, however, have far superior senses than humans and can see and smell, and --
CORALINE => Hey, Wybie.
CORALINE =>  Oh my God.
YOUNG FORCIBLE => What a piece of work is man! How noble in reason!
YOUNG SPINK => How infinite in faculty! In form and moving how express and admirable!
YOUNG FORCIBLE => In action like an angel!
YOUNG SPINK => In apprehension how like a god!
CORALINE => Ahhh!!!
YOUNG FORCIBLE => The beauty of the world!
YOUNG SPINK => The paragon of animals!
CORALINE => Yeah!!
OTHER FATHER => Hey there.
OTHER MOTHER => Was it wonderful, dear?
CORALINE => Oh yeah. They swooped down and pulled me right out of my seat  Spink and Forcible. Only they weren't old ladies, that was just a disguise. But then, I was flying through the air and... it was, it was magic.
OTHER MOTHER => You do like it here, don't you, Coraline?
CORALINE =>  Uh-huh! Good night, Wybie.
OTHER MOTHER => You could stay here forever... if you want to.
CORALINE => Really?
OTHER FATHER => Sure...we'll sing and play games, and Mother will cook your favorite meals.
OTHER MOTHER => There's one tiny little thing we need to do.
CORALINE => What's that?
OTHER FATHER => Well, it's a surprise.
OTHER MOTHER => For you ... our little doll.
OTHER MOTHER => ... though you might make me jealous.
OTHER MOTHER => Oh, but we need a yes ... if you want to stay here.
OTHER MOTHER => There now; it's your decision, darling. We only want what's best for you.
CORALINE => I'm... I'm going to bed! RIGHT NOW!
OTHER FATHER => Before dinner?
CORALINE => I'm really, really tired. Yeah...  I just need to sleep on things.
OTHER MOTHER => Well of course you do, darling... I'll be happy to tuck you in.
CORALINE =>  Oh, no thanks, uh, you-you've done so much already--
OTHER MOTHER => You're welcome. And I  we aren't worried at all, darling.
MAGIC DRAGONFLY => What's wrong, Coraline? Don't you want to play?
TOY SQUID => Yeah, I wanna hugga your face!
PHOTO FRIENDS => Hey!
CORALINE => I'm going home tonight, robots - and I won't be back.
CORALINE => Go to sleep, go to sleep, go to sleep, go to sleep!
CORALINE => Go to sleep, go to sleep...
OTHER MOTHER => There's just one tiny little thing we have to do.
CORALINE => Go to sleep, go to sleep, go to sleep...
OTHER FATHER => So sharp you won't feel a thing...
CORALINE => Go to sleep, go to sleep, go to sleep...
OTHER MOTHER => Soon you'll see things our way...
CORALINE => Mom!... Dad!..
CORALINE => Oh God, I'm still here?
CORALINE => Hey you! Where's the Other Mother?     I want to go home.
OTHER FATHER => All will be swell, soon as Mother's refreshed. Her strength is our strength.
OTHER FATHER => Mustn't talk when Mother's not here.
CORALINE => If you won't even talk to me, I'm gonna find the Other Wybie. He'll help me.
OTHER FATHER => No point; he pulled a long face...
OTHER FATHER => ...and Mother didn't like it.
CAT => And what do you think you're doing?
CORALINE => Well, I'm gettin' outta here. That's what I'M doing.
CORALINE => Huh? Something's wrong. Shouldn't the old well be here?
CAT => Nothing out here ... it's the empty part of this world. She only made what she knew would impress you.
CORALINE => But why? Why does she want me?
CAT => She wants something to love, I think. Something that isn't her... Or maybe she'd just love something to eat.
CORALINE => Eat? That's ridiculous, mothers don't eat daughters!
CAT => I don't know. How do you taste?
CORALINE => Huh? But how can you walk away from something and still come back to it?
CAT => Walk around the world.
CORALINE => Small world.
CAT => Hang on--
CORALINE => Stop, he's one of the circus mice!
CAT => I don't like rats at the best of times, but this one was sounding an alarm.
CORALINE => Gooooood kitty.
OTHER MOTHER => They say even the proudest --
OTHER MOTHER => --spirit can be broken ... with love.
OTHER MOTHER => Of course, chocolate never hurts. Like one?
OTHER MOTHER => They're Cocoa Beetles from Zanzibar.
CORALINE => I want to be with my real mom and dad. I want you to let me go.
OTHER MOTHER => Is that any way to talk to your mother?
CORALINE => You aren't my mother.
OTHER MOTHER => Apologize at once, Coraline!
CORALINE => No.
OTHER MOTHER => ...two...
CORALINE => Ow, what are you doing!
CORALINE => Ow, that hurts!
CORALINE => Who are you?
CORALINE => Why are you all here?
ALL GHOSTS => The Beldam!
BOY GHOST => And saw that we weren't    happy.
BOY GHOST => Gave all that we asked -
BOY GHOST => She said that she loved us,
ALL GHOSTS => And ate up our lives.
CORALINE => Well, she can't keep me in the dark forever; not if she wants to win my life. Beating her is my only chance.
CORALINE => Has she taken those, too?
BOY GHOST => Find our eyes, mistress, and our souls will be freed.
CORALINE => I ... I'll try.
CORALINE => Did she do this to you?
CORALINE => I hope that feels bet--
OTHER WYBIE => Shhh.
CORALINE => Let's go!
CORALINE => Come on. She'll hurt you again!
CORALINE => Anybody here? Hello, hello, hello! Real Dad ... Real Mom!
CORALINE => Oh, Mom's groceries!
CORALINE => I missed you guys so much-- You'll never--
CORALINE => Oh... the Wybie that talks...
WYBIE => Huh? Ha ha ha....yeah... Um, so you know tha-that old doll I gave you?
WYBIE => Um... my Gramma's real mad, says it was her sister's - the one that... disappeared?
WYBIE. => Well, i-it looked just like you. And I
CORALINE => It used to look like this pioneer girl; then Huck Finn junior; then it was this Little Rascals chick with all these ribbons, and braids, and....
CORALINE => Grandma's missing sister!
CORALINE => I think I just met her. C'mon!
WYBIE => Uh, listen, I-I-I'm really not supposed
CORALINE => She's in there.
WYBIE => C-can you  can you unlock it?
CORALINE => Not in a million years. But it wouldn't matter; she can't escape without her eyes. None of the ghosts can.
WYBIE => Huhhhhhh... So, uh, I really need to get that doll?
CORALINE => Great! I'd love to get rid of it!
CORALINE => Where are you hiding, you little monster?!
WYBIE => You and Gramma been talking?
CORALINE => The doll's her spy! It's how she watches you, finds out what's wrong with your life!
WYBIE => The doll...is my Gramma's...spy.
CORALINE => NO! - the Other Mother! She's got this whole world where everything's better - the food, the garden, the--  --neighbors.
CORALINE => But it's all a trap!
WYBIE => Yeah... Uh, I think I heard someone calling me, Jonesy.
CORALINE => Don't believe me?... You can ask the cat!
WYBIE => The cat... I-I'll just tell Gramma that you couldn't find the doll-- OW!
CORALINE => You're not LISTENING TO ME!
WYBIE => That's ... cause ... you're CRAZY!
CORALINE => You creep!
WYBIE =>  Crazy!!
CORALINE => Crazy?... You're the jerk-wad that gave me the doll!
CORALINE => Mom!   Dad!
CORALINE => Pick it up, Dad, pick it up.
CHARLIE => Hi!
CORALINE => Dad!   Whe-
CHARLIE => I'm digging in my garden right now, but leave a message and I'll get right back to you.
CORALINE => Where have you gone?
CORALINE => Uh... don't you only make wings for the ... dead ones?
MISS SPINK => Just looking ahead dear... Angus hasn't been feeling very well of late.
MISS FORCIBLE => April? Aren't you getting ready?
MISS SPINK =>  We've lost our ride, Miriam. Caroline says her parents have vanished, quite completely.
MISS FORCIBLE => What?! We've waited months for those tickets.
MISS SPINK => I suppose we could walk!
MISS FORCIBLE => With your gamy legs? It's nearly two miles to the theater!
MISS SPINK => Oh, oh yes ... your missing parents. We know just what you need. Miriam, get...that's right.
CORALINE => How is hundred-year-old candy going to
MISS SPINK => There you go, sweety.
CORALINE => What's it for?
MISS SPINK => Well,it might help. They're good for bad things, sometimes.
MISS FORCIBLE => No, they're good for lost things.
MISS SPINK => It's bad things, Miriam.
MISS FORCIBLE => Lost things, April.
MISS SPINK => Bad.
MISS FORCIBLE => Lost.
MISS SPINK => Bad things!
MISS FORCIBLE => Lost.
MISS SPINK => Bad.
MISS FORCIBLE => Lost.
CORALINE => Good-night, Mom. Good-night, Dad.
CORALINE => Hello. How did you get in?
CORALINE => Do you know where Mom and Dad are?
CORALINE => How did this happen?
CORALINE => She's taken them.
CORALINE => They're not coming back, are they  Mom and Dad. Not on their own.
CORALINE => Only one thing to do.
CAT => You know, you're walking right into her trap.
CORALINE => I have to go back.
CORALINE => They are my parents.
CAT => Challenge her then. She may not play fair but she won't refuse. She's got a thing for games.
CORALINE => Hmmm, okay.
MOTHER => Coraline?
CORALINE => Mom?
MOTHER => Coraline, you came back for us!

CORALINE => My real parents.
CORALINE => And, and the eyes of the ghost children.
CORALINE => If I lose, I'll stay here with you forever and let you love me.  And I'll let you sew buttons into my eyes.
CORALINE => Then you let me go. You let everyone go my real father and mother, the dead children, everyone you've trapped here.
CORALINE => Not till you give me a clue.
CORALINE => And for my parents?
CORALINE => ...it's a deal--
