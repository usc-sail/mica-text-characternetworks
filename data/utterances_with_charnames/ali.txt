SONNY LISTON =>  Gonna fuck you up. Gonna beat you like I's your daddy...
Alabama. => CASSIUS, JR.
ANGELO DUNDEE => TIME!
MALCOLM X => ...and those of you who think you came here to hear us tell you, like these Negro leaders do, that times will get better and we shall overcome someday, I tell you: you came to the wrong place.
MALCOLM X => 'Cause your times will never get better until yo make them better. And any of you who think you came here to hear us tell you to turn the other cheek to the brutality of the white man and the established system of injustice in this country, to beg for your place at their lunch counter, I say again! You came to the wrong place.
MALCOLM X =>  'Cause we don't teach you to turn the other cheek. We don't teach you to turn the other cheek in the South. We don't teach you to turn the other cheek in the North. The Honorable Elijah Muhammad teaches you, instead, to obey the law. To carry yourselves in a respectable way. And a proud Afro-American way. But at the same time...we teach you...that anyone who puts his hand on you? Do your BEST...to see he doesn't PUT HIS HAND on any...body...else...AGAIN.
ANGELO DUNDEE => TIME!!!
CASSIUS/BUNDINI =>  Float like a butterfly! Sting like a bee! Rumble, young man, rumble. Aaaaaaargh!
CASSIUS => Sonny Liston: you ain't no champ! You a chump!  You want to lose your money, bet on Sonny. He know I'm great. He will go in eight!
CASSIUS => What you lookin' at, you ugly bear?!
CASSIUS => C'mon, bum. I whup you right here!
A MAN =>  ...210... Cassius Clay weighs 210 pounds.
CASSIUS =>  You sure you got that right...?
THE MAN => 218. Sonny Liston...the heavyweight champion of the world weighs 218 pounds...
BUNDINI => Pounds of what?!
CASSIUS => Pounds of ugly! He so ugly, sweat run backwards off his forehead to get away from his face! C'mon, bear! I turn you into a rug!! Rumble right now, man!
SONNY LISTON =>  Keep talkin', punk-ass faggot! I'll fuck you up like I's your daddy...
CASSIUS => You whup me, I'll crawl out of the ring on my knees and catch the next jet plane out of the country.
JIMMY CANNON =>  That a promise?
CASSIUS =>  ...you be the first eatin' his words!
THE DOCTOR =>  210 over 110?! I can't let him in the ring in this condition!
REPORTERS =>  Liston says he'll talk with his fists. "Lip from Louisville."  ...odds 7:1 against you. Big bet's whether he'll knock you out in the first round or third round or kill you altogether. You scared of him?
CASSIUS => I'm scared of no man. I give Sonny Liston talking lessons, boxing lessons and falling down lessons.
CANNON/OTHERS => Yeah, sure. Are you a Black Muslim? Pat Putnam in the Miami Herald said...
CASSIUS => "Black Muslim"'s a press word...
ANGELO DUNDEE => Man's religion's his own business. What kinda question's that?
REPORTERS/HOWARD COSELL => Does he hate white people? Malcolm X was in town. Then he left. Was that so he wouldn't embarrass you? Liston cannot stand you...
ANGELO DUNDEE =>  Howard!
HOWARD COSELL => ...cannot stand you, Cassius.   He really wants to kill you...
CASSIUS => Howard Cosell, you are an instigator!  How you get that way? When I'm done with Liston, I'm comin' for you!
DOCTOR =>  It doesn't come down, I cancel this fight. You call me in an hour with his blood pressure.
BUNDINI =>  I'm called Bundini, rhymes with Houdini. He was a Jew, too...some other people call me Fastblack...or Daddy Mac...
BUNDINI =>  Shorty sent me to Sugar Ray Robinson. I gave my power to Sugar Ray for seven years, gave him my voodoo, my magic. Now Shorty sent me to you.
CASSIUS => Who Shorty?
BUNDINI => I call him Shorty 'cause he like 'em circumcised. Original people. Like Moses. And I was a babe in a basket, too. I was born on a doorstep with a note 'cross my chest that read, "Do the best you can for him, world." I had to suck the first nipple come along. I didn't run away from home...I been runnin' to home.
BUNDINI =>  Now, I gotta ask you. You fixin' them fights? Else no way you could tell great Archie Moore what round you droppin' him in...all of them predictions you make, comin' true. Never heard of nobody predictin' the round like you. You either a phony or Shorty's in your corner. Tell me the truth, young man...
CASSIUS => ...I study every fight. 'Til I got a plan. Wear him down two through four. Drop him in the fifth round. So the p'diction ain't a p'diction. It's a plan. And 'cause of all the poppin' off I do, I know I gotta win! That's the truth. And why I'm tellin' you?
BUNDINI => 'Cause I'm gonna be your Inspiration. Your motivator. In your corner. Can I be in your corner, young man?
CASSIUS =>  Yeah...
BUNDINI =>  Ain't spent much time in Miami. Where the water?
PACHECO => 120 over 80? (re: his blood pressure) You should be asleep...
CASSIUS => When you get back?
MALCOLM X => Just now.    I'm front row, seat 7.
RUDY => I'm gonna find Mom and Dad.
CASSIUS => You could have stayed. Nobody gotta hide when they with me.
MALCOLM X => Nothing wrong with being cool, my brother. You been working toward this moment for four years.
ANGELO DUNDEE =>  He's right.
MALCOLM X => It's a crusade in modern times. And television is beaming if off Telstar to the whole world. So Allah has brought this about for a reason...  Salaam alaikum, my brother...
CASSIUS => He was supposed to kill me.   Well, I'm still alive.
ANNOUNCER =>  He's opened a cut on Liston. Liston's never been cut!
CASSIUS =>  He's nothin' to me...
CASSIUS => And he knows it...
CASSIUS => ...my eyes!
CASSIUS =>  My eyes! I can't see...somethin' in my eyes!
CASSIUS =>  Cut 'em off! Cut 'em!   I'm blind.
ANGELO DUNDEE => No. You quit, it's over! Get out there. Be a yardstick. This is the big one, daddy. Get out there and run!
HOWARD COSELL =>  ...Clay, a round ago, looked like he'd about had it, but in round six...
HOWARD COSELL =>  Sonny Liston is not coming out! Wait a minute! Wait a minute! Sonny Liston is not coming out!
HOWARD COSELL => The winner...and the new heavyweight champion of the world is Cassius Clay!
CASSIUS => I upset the world! I am the greatest! I am the greatest!
CASSIUS =>  Eat your words! Eat your words!
HOWARD COSELL => What made him so easy for you?
CASSIUS => I told you. Didn't I tell you?
HOWARD COSELL => Was there any single point you knew you had him?
CASSIUS => I had him in the first round. 'Cause I'm the greatest! (and seeing at ringside, calling him up) Sam... Hey, Sam! Let him up.
CASSIUS => I am the greatest! And he the greatest rock 'n' roll singer. Sam Cooke! I want everybody to bear witness.  I shook up the world! Don't have a mark on me! I was burning. I was blind. I'm the prettiest thing that ever lived. I shook up the world! I shook up the world!
GORDON DAVIDSON => ...I don't care what should have been ordered! We need a victory party right now.  I got national press, the family, the champ, all kinds of folks...  250 to 300. Yes.
GIRL => Why's he so scared?
MALCOLM X => Man, look at that guy run!
CASSIUS => The Mummy! "I can't get away from the mummy!" Yeah, but that mummy too slow to catch anybody.
SAM COOKE => Hey!   The mummy always gets his man...
CASSIUS => No, he don't!  Now, don't believe that stuff on television...
A REPORTER => The people look to you. Do you plan on being a people's champ, like Joe Louis?
CASSIUS =>  Yeah. I going to be a people's champ...  But not like Joe Louis, exactly...
A REPORTER =>  Mr. Clay...?
CASSIUS => And I'm not Clay. Clay's the name of the people who owned by ancestors. I don't want to be called after that slave name no more. So I'm "X." Cassius X. And I'm a member of the Nation of Islam. The Honorable Elijah Muhammad is my spiritual guide. Malcolm X is my mentor.
REPORTERS =>  You a card-carrying member?    Aren't Black Muslims a hate group?
CASSIUS =>  "Card-carrying"...? Don't need no "card." You got a Christian card? 750 million people believe in Islam. I'm one of them.
ANOTHER REPORTER => Minister Malcolm...what about the reports of a split between you and Elijah Muhammad?
MALCOLM X => This is the champ's time. And I'm here as a friend to celebrate his victory. So I got nothing you want...
CASSIUS => I'm going to be a people's champion. But I don't have to be the way you want me to be. I'm gonna be what I want. And I'm free to think any way I want...
MALCOLM X => I was leaving, saw the light on...how come you're up?
CASSIUS =>  ...watchin' a show on termites...they knockin' down this house, here.
MALCOLM X => I been invited to speak at Ibadan University in Nigeria. C'mon with me?
CASSIUS => Six million in your house and you don't know it. Where?
MALCOLM X => Africa.   You been there?
CASSIUS => Africa? No. Only Rome.      Yeah, man, let's go!
MALCOLM X => Nkrumah stayed with me when he was a student in New York, so we'll stop in Ghana...
CASSIUS => When we leaving?
MALCOLM X => Next Thursday.
CASSIUS =>  What is it?
MALCOLM X => You ever been so angry...have you ever been so angry that you'd explode?
CASSIUS =>  Tore out a picture of Emmett Till when I was little. Couldn't take my eyes to it...couldn't look at it. Barb-wire around his neck to a 75- pound cotton-gin fan. Took out his eye. The cruelty to it...I couldn't look at it...couldn't throw it away.
MALCOLM X => What else?
CASSIUS => I thought, "What I do wrong to be so low that people could do that to people like me?" It made me feel ashamed. And that makes no sense. But that's what it was.
MALCOLM X => ...when I heard about the four girls bombed in the 16th Street Church in Birmingham?  The prohibitions of the Honorable Elijah Muhammad prevented me from speaking my voice in action. Because Birmingham was part of the civil rights movement, begging for a place at the white man's table... But dead children...are dead children. So the anger I felt, I had to contain. I locked that down! So tight my muscles seized. I lost control over the right side of my body. Leg didn't work...right arm didn't work. "I'm having a stroke," I thought. I had to hold it in 'cause I wanted, all I wanted was to BREAK SOMETHING! Break a part...any part of this system. Because you are so provoked as a human being. In your spirit. In your heart... At the death of children. But I COULD DO...nothing.
MALCOLM X =>  Everyone knows... Now I'm advocating more direct political action involvement with the international struggle... So Elijah Muhammad has suspended me as a Minister in the Nation of Islam for 90 days.
CASSIUS => You can fix that...
MALCOLM X => I don't know. I will try when we get back. Until then I will live each day as if I am already dead.
ELIJAH MUHAMMAD => Only after long service and high merit in the spiritual and physical rebirth of Afro-American people...is one granted an original name. But you are special. A world champion. So there is a gift I wish to give you. From this day forward you will be known as Muhammad Ali...which means "one worthy of praise," and Ali means "most high."
CASSIUS =>  Muhammad Ali.  "Worthy of praise..." Thank you!
ELIJAH MUHAMMAD =>  Be very careful what you say...your words reflect on the nation of Islam, now.
CASSIUS => Yes, sir.
ELIJAH MUHAMMAD =>  Up until now, I have entrusted your spiritual development to Brother Malcolm.  I do not feel this is a wise course anymore.
ELIJAH MUHAMMAD => Malcolm has gone off into the secular world and does not measure his words. I have decided to give you, as your guide, my very own son, Herbert Muhammad.
ELIJAH MUHAMMAD => Herbert will supervise all of your spiritual and material needs.
CASSIUS =>  This is a great honor, Messenger...
A NEIGHBOR =>  Could we get a picture with you?  You mind, Mr. Clay?
A NEIGHBOR => One more.  Thank you.
ALI => When the contract run out. I want black lawyers and managers. Chauncey Eskridge on North La Salle Street...
ALI => I don't need no "protectin'" from myself. Why I need protecting from myself by them...?
ALI => I ain't one of their thoroughbreds! Or their charity things. "Let's do somethin' for that well-behaved colored boy, Cassius." I ain't well-behaved nothing! I am a man.
ALI => And I am not Cassius. I changed my name. I am Muhammad Ali, now.
ALI => That's right.
ALI => No one "made me"...
ALI =>  I made me.  No one's in that ring but me!
ALI => I know who I'm not...I'm not drinkin'! Goin' back on my wife! I am not prayin' to no blue-eyed, blonde-haired Jesus. I ain't...
ODESSA CLAY => You didn't get it from me...your words, your sense of humor, what makes you angry, what makes you a fighter. You got that from your daddy...
ALI => You saying I'm just like him?
ODESSA CLAY => I'm saying, if he was your age today, he'd do the same as you. And he knows that.
JOSEPH 13X => Brother Malcolm...
MALCOLM X => What is it, Joseph?
JOSEPH 13X => The Honorable Elijah Muhammad has given the Muslim name, Muhammad Ali, to Cassius X. Herbert Muhammad's been placed in charge of his training, instead of you.  Muhammad Ali will not be traveling with you to Africa.
JOSEPH 13X => The Honorable Elijah Muhammad has asked me to inform you your suspension has been extended indefinitely.
BETTY SHABAZZ =>  Malcolm?
MALCOLM X =>  Cassius won't be coming to Africa...not with me.
BETTY SHABAZZ => Go anyway. Don't put it off.      It's not safe here. ONE OF HIS CHILDREN  Mommy...the bath's ready...
ALI =>  Hey, man, where they put the real pilot? What you doin' up here?
PILOT =>  I am...the pilot. He's the copilot...  Here, Mr. Clay, sit down...
ALI => No, man, I meant...in L'ville, when I growed up, they barely let black folks drive buses.
THE PILOT => Here we are. Cote d'Ivoire...Africa.
BETTY SHABAZZ => We should think of a name, Malcolm...
MALCOLM X => How about Gamilah or Khalilah?
MARLIN THOMAS =>  Anything?
THE MAN => ...on the phone with his wife. She's having a hard time sleeping...baby's kicking a lot...
MARLIN THOMAS => Motor Pool, here, have a Chevy parts catalogue...?
MALCOLM X =>  Brother Muhammad...
ALI => Hey, man!!!
ALI => How you doin'? What's up, brother? I knew you were here...didn't think you were still here...
MALCOLM X => And I heard you were coming.
ALI => We just got here now...  And, maaan, the brothers were flyin' a DC 8. Flippin' switches, navigatin', filing flight plans, talkin' French...
ALI => Where you goin'?
MALCOLM X => When...uh, Liberia.   When you fighting Liston? ALI November.
MALCOLM X => This is Maya Angelou and Ambassador Huang Ha. Amando Gonzalez is from Cuba. Taher Kaid is the Ambassador from Algeria.
ALI => Man, where should I go?   We're planning on Egypt.
MALCOLM X => Algeria. See Ben Bella...  Go to Mecca, Medina. I just came back. Made my seven circuits around the Kaaba, prayed at sunrise... There were two million people...pilgrims from all over. Dressed all the same, high and low, the same. Blonde-haired, blue-eyed Muslims. Arabs. (off Ali's look of surprise) Blacks. Yeah. All of them, Muslims praying together.
BRADLEY => Hello...?
MALCOLM X => It's Marlin. You'll never guess who Malcolm ran into...
BRADLEY =>  Un moment...
BRADLEY =>  Hold on a second...
BRADLEY =>  Il n'y a pas de quoi. Cela m'a fait grand plaisir. Faites-lui mes compliments.
BRADLEY =>  It's nothing. Give him my compliments.
MARLIN THOMAS => Malcolm bumped into Cassius Clay. Muhammad Ali...whatever he calls himself...
BRADLEY => I thought that was all over. Is Clay going to support Malcolm's U.N. resolution?
MARLIN THOMAS => I don't know.
BRADLEY => Find out. We'll pick up on Malcolm in Liberia ourselves.
MALCOLM X => Drank from the well of Zem-Zem... And you should visit Cairo. I have friends there in...
ALI =>  ...shouldn't have quarreled with the Honorable Elijah...
ALI =>  You shouldn't have...  ...quarreled with the honorable Elijah Muhammad...
MALCOLM X => What?
ALI => You shouldn't have quarreled with Elijah Muhammad.
MALCOLM X => Brother Muhammad...
MALCOLM X => Brother Muhammad...!
ALI => Sonji...Sonji Roi...
SONJI =>  What you keep sayin' my name for?
ALI => 'Cause I love it, girl. How long you been workin' for Herbert?
SONJI => 'Bout a year. I sell "Muhammad Speaks" over the phone...
ALI => What kind of name is that?
SONJI => My father named me after Sonja Henie.
ALI => What's your father do?
SONJI => He was shot in a poker game when I was two. He don't do nothin'. Sonja, on the other hand, was an ice skater, and my mother died when I was eleven.
ALI => So who raised you?
SONJI => Godparents, but I been on my own, doing my own thing...
ALI => Whatcha doin' tomorrow?       Go ridin' with me.
SONJI => No.   I gotta work, you know.
ALI => I square it with Herbert.       I got a record player in my car.
SONJI => A record player?     C'mon.    How come it don't skip?
ALI => Got springs and stuff.
SONJI => Herbert said you met The Beatles.
ALI => Yeah. Only one of 'em's smart...the one with the glasses.
SONJI => ...he's my favorite.
ALI => People all screaming and fainting. I asked him, "This the way they act when you get big?"
SONJI => What he say?
ALI => He said, "Champ. The more real you get, the more unreal it gonna get."
SONJI => Wow...
ALI => Let's go...
SONJI => Yeah...
ALI =>  Where you live?
SONJI => I'm takin' you there...
ALI => I think I gonna keep you around forever, girl.
SONJI =>  Well, I'm not too busy right now, so...I'll think on it.
ALI => Herbert said you weren't a Muslim.
SONJI => Cover my hair? No make-up?     Long dresses? Honey, please.  Were you a virgin?
ALI => Why?
SONJI =>  'Cause you so "gone" off a little good time.
ALI => I'm no virgin...but I may as well be.  I ain't jokin'! I always know when I know. See this face? I mean, you got a pretty face for a girl's face, but you ever seen somethin' as pretty as me? Now, you about five-foot-three...that's too small. But I overlook that, too, 'cause...
SONJI =>  Thank you so much.
ALI => ...'cause of your spirit!
SONJI => My "spirit"...?
ALI => Yeah.   'Cause you too much fun!
SONJI => You serious?
ALI => But you gotta be a Muslim.
SONJI => Huh? How you do that? Step over a broom...shazaam...you a Muslim?
ALI => Maaan, I ain't never been with a girl like you.
SONJI => Baby, maybe you ain't ever gonna be with any other.
HERBERT => What?
ALI => That's right.   I wanna marry her.
HERBERT => You can't marry that girl! She was a date! Have some fun! She's not your wife! You don't marry this girl. (puts contracts in front of him) Sign there. Management papers. My father will kill me.
BUNDINI => True love!
BINGHAM => Watch what you signing, Ali.
HERBERT =>  Nothing to do with you.
BINGHAM => You talkin' to me, or someone walk inna room, fat boy? Anything's do to with me I think's to d-d-do with me...I'm st-st-still a Christian.
ALI =>  And get me a kosher cook...lady who cooks at Malcolm's temple. Put my brother on the payroll. 50g a year for drivin' and jivin'.
HERBERT => Lana Shabazz...
ALI => Yeah. How 'bout it, Howard. You be my official full-time photographer.
BINGHAM => I ain't goin' on your payroll. I like it freelance. Emphasis on "free."
HERBERT => Muhammad. She's not...for you. When I met her, she was working at a cocktail lounge with a bunny tail on her backside.
BUNDINI => What were you doin' down at a cocktail lounge, Herbert? Sellin' "Muhammad Peeks"?
HERBERT =>  Sober up and say something to this man, Bundini. You supposed to be his "inspiration."
BUNDINI =>  I got to know about Sonji, Muhammad. She got a sister? 
BINGHAM => You been s-s-saving it up, training, Champ. You can't unleash it on this girl all sudden. You may kill her! Maybe you should spread it around more before you tie it down.
ALI => No. Marriage is the cornerstone of Muslim life.
HERBERT => Sonji Roi is not a Muslim!
ALI => She gonna be a Muslim, now!  So fix it up, Herbert.
JOSEPH 13X => Why we meeting?
JOE SMILEY => The idea was...to...make...Malcolm smaller, you know? Diminished; obscure? Not to turn him into a messiah.  What I got, now, is Malcolm shoulder to shoulder with Martin Luther King.  And Malcolm running all over the world getting Ben Bella and Nasser to denounce racism in the U.S. while we're competing over there with the Soviets. 
JOE SMILEY =>  Not...a resounding success. We were better off before, with Malcolm INSIDE the Nation.  So... We want you...to get Elijah Muhammad...to take Malcolm back.
JOE SMILEY => That's a joke. I'm kidding! Don't you ever smile?
JOE SMILEY => We're on a timetable. Malcolm's pal, Quaison from Ghana, is introducing Malcolm's resolution to the General Assembly in Washington. That's in five weeks.
JOSEPH 13X => You got bad breath, man.
JOE SMILEY => Thyroid. I got a stab wound in 1961. They took it out. We gotta talk about this guy, too.
JOSEPH 13X => When do I get my expenses reimbursed...dry cleaning lots of suits isn't free...
ALI =>  What you drinkin'?
BUNDINI => What am I drinkin'? Water's what I'm drinkin', champ! I'm a natural man...
ALI => What's goin' on?     We're late.
SONJI => I'm changing my damn clothes! You didn't like what I was wearin'!
BUNDINI => Come on in...!  What's that?
ROOM SERVICE =>  What you wanted, isn't it...a water glass with vodka...?
BUNDINI => That was before...
ROOM SERVICE => Before what?
BUNDINI => Before you showed up...
SONJI => I fine runnin' around in all these cute short things for you. I submissive to you. But I ain't gonna be submissive to the Brother X's and what they think. They askin' me questions alla time anyway.
ALI => What questions?!
SONJI => About you and us and I ain't tellin' 'em shit.
SONJI => I don't drink. I don't smoke. I converted to Islam for you and...
SONJI => All except the dress! I ain't puttin' no bleached-out, double- ugly bedsheets on this body, honey! I'm normal!
of Chicago... => DADDIO  Hey there, old, aware ones. And you, too, my fair ones...This is "Daddio's Jazz Patio." ON KBCA this fine day, which is A-okay...
MALCOLM X => As-Salaam Alaikum...
THE GATHERED => Wa-Alaikum-Salaam...
MALCOLM X => Hold it, hold it, brothers!  Let's be cool.
CRAZY MAN => Ambushed!
CRAZY MAN => From the bullet holes, black eagles flew! They screaming through the streets...
ALI => What? CRAZY MAN  They killed Malcolm...they shot Malcolm.
ALI =>  You were the first...you walked me forward, my brother...you were the first...
SAM COOKE =>  "Been a long, long time comin', but a change gonna come, yes it is..."
NIGHT => HOWARD COSELL ...the arena is surrounded by FBI, the stands are only half full, the promoter has taken out a million- dollar insurance policy due to Cassius Clay's membership in the militant and radical Black Muslims because of death threats. Oh, and by the way...Sonny Liston is here, too.
ALI => meets Liston, nails him with a straight right. Ali begins baiting him, dancing. Liston tries to cut off the ring, jabbing ineffectually. Ali lets Liston in, pulls back, then pivots on his right foot, throws a short right and RAMP INTO SLO-MO...to see Liston not see it coming.
HOWARD COSELL => Liston is down! Scarcely a minute into the first round, I can't believe it!
ALI => Get up, sucker! Get up and fight! No one gonna believe this!
HOWARD COSELL => It's over; it's over!
SONJI => You okay?  What's wrong?
ALI => Why you done up like that?
SONJI => I'm dyin' and...'cause this is how I dress! I dyin' for you out of worry...
ALI => "Worry"...?
SONJI => Yeah. And all you care about is if I look dull enough?
ALI => The world looks at me, girl! What if I straightened my hair, live in the white suburbs? How I am says something!
SONJI =>  Well, sorry you don't like how I am...
ALI =>  Where's Herbert?
ALI => What do I do...?
HERBERT => If you want, have no contact with her for ninety days. Then you make a public statement of divorce in the mosque, and Islamic law will be satisfied.
BUNDINI => "Satisfied?"...satisfaction is not makin' it with the woman who send you to the moon?
BUNDINI => Man, I'm the only normal person left around here and I'm a black Jew who can't read and is half drunk.
ALI => Please stay, Brother Herbert.
ALI => I ain't dead!
COSMETOLOGIST => You got the prettiest eyes...
ALI => Yeah?
BUNDINI => He so pretty, when you look up "pretty" in the dictionary, he too pretty to be there.
A.D. =>  ...you gonna try for Germany?
ALI => Huh?
A.D. => You gonna try to get stationed in Germany?
ALI => What you talking about?
BUNDINI => Champ.   It's Eskridge...
A.D. =>  They changed your classification.  It's in the paper...You're 1-A. You're gonna get drafted into the Army...
ALI =>  You know about this?
CHAUNCEY ESKRIDGE => Yes. But I think the government's looking to negotiate a deal...
A.D. =>  Here we go...!
ALI => ...I flunk their draft board test. Now, without testing if I am "wiser" or "worser," they decide I can go into the Army.
HOWARD COSELL => Cassius, it is my opinion you...
ALI =>  And I'm not Cassius Clay. That's a slave name. I'm a free man. I'm Muhammad Ali.
HOWARD COSELL =>  You know, I apologize to you. On the air. Your name is Muhammad Ali. You have the right to be called whatever you want.
ALI =>  You make a lot of mistakes for a so-called educated man. You really go to law school?
HOWARD COSELL => Yes, Muhammad. And to think I gave up a lucrative practice for the likes of you.
ALI => I'm the best thing that ever happened to you, Howard Cosell. Without me you be a tall white man with a microphone in his mouth.
HOWARD COSELL =>  And without me...you'd be a mouth.
HOWARD COSELL =>  We'll be right back.
HOWARD COSELL =>  Have a little coffee with your sugar...?
ALI => Keep talking. You were saying something half-smart...
HOWARD COSELL => They want to make an example out of you.
ALI => Why? I'm no Stokely Carmichael, H. Rap Brown...
HOWARD COSELL => All they are is political. They tell people how they ought to be. But you are the HEAVYWEIGHT CHAMPION of the WORLD. You're important. And they don't like your militancy, your politics. So, they'll make an example out of you.
ALI => ...of a good "Ne-gro," who do what he told?
HOWARD COSELL => Yes. Or, to demonstrate here is what happens to your ass if you don't...
CHAUNCEY ESKRIDGE =>  You do six weeks basic...you go into the Reserves...you don't go to Vietnam...you get to box...you even get to keep the money...
HERBERT =>  The Messenger would not object if you joined under these terms.
ALI => I stay out of jail and I get to fight. HERBERT  All you have to do is accept the induction. And life goes on.
CHAUNCEY ESKRIDGE => They call your name. You say yes.
ALI =>  Yes.
A MAN =>  Federal Bureau of Investigation. Mr. Clay, you're under arrest for refusing induction...
ALI =>  Ask Chauncey Eskridge in Chicago. He's my lawyer. No. I'm out on bail. (goes onto balcony [rear shot]) Yeah, I fight. I fight clean. I'm an athlete. Army's there to kill, kill, kill. My religion forbids that. No. I never shot anything in my life.  Do I know where Vietnam is? (wry; playing to Bingham) Yeah. It's on TV...  In southeast Asia? It there, too?  That's a joke, man...!
ALI =>  What do I think about who?      Vietcong?
ALI => Man, I ain't got no quarrel with them Vietcong.
ALI => No Vietcong ever called me nigger.
BINGHAM => You know what you j-j-just said...?
LIPSYTE => From Europe to China...every home in America...the world's gonna know what the heavyweight champion of the world said about the U.S. war...
ALI => So what?  I ain't gonna be what anybody else want me to be. I'm not afraid to be what I want. And think how I want.
LIPSYTE =>  Nixon, the Republicans, Boxing Commission in New York, Cleveland and L.A.  But you're also getting attacked as unpatriotic by the NAACP, Roy Wilkins, Jackie Robinson, the New York Times and Joe Louis...
ALI =>  People are following me...
BOB ARUM => I got almost nowhere I can promote a fight for you. Plus, I think they're going to vacate you from the crown.
ALI => What?
BOB ARUM => Yeah.   If you're convicted.
ALI => They gonna take away what no fighter in the world can?
BOB ARUM => And New York may revoke your boxing license.
CHAUNCEY ESKRIDGE => You sure you want to do all this?  Your next three to four years are every heavyweight's prime. And there are few of those years...
ALI => What 'bout Terrell?
BOB ARUM => We'll know if we can fight Terrell in Illinois this afternoon. Terrell's running his mouth. He said if you're called, you should serve...
ALI =>  Motherfucker. He got a deferment for bein' too tall, or havin' flat feet. Why don't he serve for me? Tellin' me what I should do...
BOB ARUM =>  I got to get you some fights.    Fast.
COMMISSIONER => You understand we could take away your license to fight Terrell in Illinois?
ALI => Yes.
COMMISSIONER => Are you prepared to apologize? About your unpatriotic remarks that you made?
ALI => Apologize? No.
COMMISSIONER => You said that you were the people's champion.
ALI =>  Yes, sir!
COMMISSIONER => Do you think you're acting like the people's champion...?!
ALI => Yes, sir. I am not going to apologize to you. This isn't a courtroom. And I don't have to sit here and answer your questions.
ALI => I ain't draft dodgin'! I ain't goin' to Canada. I ain't burnin' my draft card. I ain't burnin' the flag. I'm stayin' right here. And you want to throw me in jail? Go ahead. I'll do my time. I been in jail four hundred years. I'll be in jail four, five more. But I ain't goin' ten thousand miles to help murder and kill poor people for you. 'Cause if I'm gonna die, I'll die now, right here, fighting you. If I wanna die. You my enemy, not Vietcong or Chinese or Japanese. You my opposer when I want freedom. You my opposer when I want justice. You my opposer when I want equality. You want me to go somewhere for you, but you won't even stand up for me in America, for my rights and beliefs, you won't even stand up for me here at home.
ERNIE TERRELL =>  Tell Clay he can get on after me.
ALI => What...?
ERNIE TERRELL => Get on the scale after...
ALI =>  What you call me...?
ERNIE TERRELL => Only thing I knows you as:   Cassius Clay!
ALI =>  Announce it right here or from flat on your back!
ALI => What's my name?!?
ALI => What's my name, motherfucker?!
ALI => What's my name? Ali, at the apex of his athletic skills, fires six- or eight-punch combinations and then changes direction. Ali shoots jabs and hooks going backwards; every move and set of combinations is a dance. Ali's never been as light on his feet, as fast, as complex as in this fight. Like any moment of greatness, we want it to last forever... Then, Ali throws a 17-punch combination.
ALI => WHAT'S MY NAME?!
ALI =>  My name?! WHAT'S MY NAME?!
ALI =>  If the court would give me my sentence right now instead of waiting and stalling.
JUDGE INGRAHAM =>  My pleasure. The jury has found you guilty of refusing induction into the United States armed forces. I sentence you to the maximum sentence allowable...five years' imprisonment and a fine of ten thousand dollars.  Fast enough? Your attorney will lodge an appeal. While you're out on bond, I order your passport surrendered. I'll not have you benefitting yourself by fighting abroad...
ALI => Watch now...
ALI =>  Blow on it...
ALI => This spooky! Don't get scared...
BELINDA =>  See, you don't need to fight no more...
ALI => So what's fresh, girl?
BELINDA =>  Everything fresh!
ALI =>  What's the freshest of the freshest?
BELINDA =>  Doughnuts just came out...
ALI =>  Feed me those things, I gotta come back as a wrassler.  645 pounds. I'd still be pretty...but I be fat pretty...
BELINDA => You don't remember when you met me once before...long ago...
ALI =>  I remember something...   Wha's your name?
BELINDA => You know my name! You came to my school, right before you win the title. Interviewed you for the school paper. I was eleven.
ALI => You had a long braid...
BELINDA => Yeah! You called me little Indian girl, then.
ALI => That was you?
BELINDA => I loved you then, like all those kids. I never stopped. I still do.
ELIJAH MUHAMMAD => 
ALI => You see the Ellis-Quarry fight?
CHAUNCEY ESKRIDGE => Yes... We'll be in front of the U.S. Court of Appeals next month. We'll lose. Then we appeal to the Supreme Court.
ALI => Ellis the champ? Man. I beatin' on him since we was sixteen. They give Ellis to Joe Frazier? Frazier'll kill him. Then they out of juice. Where's the gate? So they gotta let me fight. I fight Ellis in a phone booth...middle of Times Square...you think that draw a crowd?
CHAUNCEY ESKRIDGE => Draw a crowd or not draw a crowd, Muhammad, is NOT going to make a difference with your boxing licenses. They don't want you to fight.  ACLU's handling your case against the New York Boxing Commission. They discovered New York's got actual ex-murderers and ex-rapists currently licensed to fight. But revoked yours...?
ALI => Tijuana? CHAUNCEY ESKRIDGE No. State Department refused permission for the one-hour visa. No fight in Tijuana. Look...
ALI => Can't fight here. Can't fight outside the country...
CHAUNCEY ESKRIDGE => I know people in the restaurant business...want to start up a chain. Muhammad Ali's "Champ Burger"..."Muhammad Malts," "Fist Full of Fries"...all of that.
ALI => Why I want to be in the restaurant business?!
CHAUNCEY ESKRIDGE => 'Cause you need the money.
ALI => How much all this gonna cost?
CHAUNCEY ESKRIDGE => Too much.    They do that to you, too, you know.
CHAUNCEY ESKRIDGE => Where you goin'?
ALI =>  Look out!
CUSTOMER => Hey, champ!
ALI => Not then...
BELINDA => First time? 1961...Sister Khalilah introduced you at assembly. You said you would be heavyweight champion of the world by the time you were twenty-one!
ALI => I always tell the truth...
BELINDA => I was eleven. I interviewed you for the student paper. You called me "little Indian girl," 'cause I wore my hair real long, in a braid...I told you..."Man, you scribble! You can't even write! You ought to go back to school until you do it better..."
JIMI HENDRIX =>  "There must be some kind of way outta here, said the joker to the thief..."
JIMI HENDRIX => "There's too much confusion, I can't get no relief. Business men, they drink my wine, plowmen dig my earth, None of them along the line, know what any of it is worth."
JIMI HENDRIX => "No reason to get excited, the thief, he kindly spoke. There are many here among us, who feel that life is but a joke."
JIMI HENDRIX => "But you and I, we've been through that, and this is not our fate. So let us not talk falsely now, the hour it's getting late..."
JIMI HENDRIX => "All along the watchtower, princes kept the view, while all the women came and went, barefoot servants, too."
CHAUNCEY ESKRIDGE => ...struck out at the appellate level in New Orleans. So we're heading back to the Supreme Court...
ALI => Thought we already got turned down there.
CHAUNCEY ESKRIDGE => I'm petitioning on a conscientious objection basis. Religious belief. We'll petition that your sincere religious belief prohibits you from shooting people. I believe they'll hear that...
ALI => Where the money come from, Chauncey? Herbert tell me I'm runnin' on empty. Put aside "how do that happen"? Licenses all revoked. No passport. I can't fight here. Can't fight abroad.  And what happen if I lose the Supreme Court?
CHAUNCEY ESKRIDGE => It's all over. You go to jail for five years.
JIMI HENDRIX => "Outside in the cold distance, a wild cat did growl, two riders were approaching, and the wind began to HOWL!"
BINGHAM => Ellis doesn't belong in there.
ALI =>  Man give him a shot, he took a shot.
BINGHAM => I saw Bundini in New York.
ALI => How's he?
BINGHAM => ...bad shape. You better get your belt b-b-back... Belinda brings coffee to Bingham...
BELINDA => She's got to be done with that bottle.
BINGHAM => You call your parents, Ali?
BELINDA => No, he didn't. I told them about the one on the way...myself. 
BINGHAM => You p-p-p-promised you'd call them.
ALI => I'll call 'em, I'll call 'em...  May-may! It go in one end and come out the other.
BELINDA => You wanna try changing her, for the experience?
ALI => You so much better at it, mama.
ALI =>  Maaan...Joe Frazier can't talk, can't up the gate, can't fill the arena. They gotta let me fight.
BELINDA => That happen, you promise me you put some new people around you.
ALI => I need Angelo, Rudy, Ferdie --
BINGHAM => Ali, she's talkin' about "Brother" Herbert.
BELINDA => Where are they when we need them? You got Gene Kilroy droppin' off groceries like charity. Borrowin' money from my folks. So...?
HOWARD COSELL => What are your feelings about up- and-coming Ken Norton?
FRAZIER =>  Norton's big and strong, but...
HOWARD COSELL =>  Hold on one second...we have a caller. Go ahead.
ALI =>  Cosell? This Muhammad Ali.
ALI => Go to Georgia or Alabama or Sweden. Everybody know I'm the champ. The crown is a lie. I know it's a lie. Joe Frazier know it's a lie. It time for everybody to stop lying and tell the truth.
HOWARD COSELL => Let's tell it like it is. With your court and boxing problems, Muhammad, can you get a fight promoted?
ALI => I ain't interested in the paycheck, I'd fight Joe Frazier for free in a phone booth in Times Square, if I wasn't broke. I still will.
HOWARD COSELL => Did you say you were broke?   How can you be broke?
HOWARD COSELL => You've made more money than all previous heavyweight champions combined. What about your management? Surely they have provided for you...
ALI => I'm saying it's time for everybody to quit lying! Muhammad Ali is the champ! I have to, I'll get the fight on myself.  And if they offer me money, I ain't gonna turn it down.
ELIJAH MUHAMMAD => Get me my son, Herbert, on the telephone!
ELIJAH MUHAMMAD => Mr. Muhammad Ali desires to do that which the Holy Qur'an teaches him against. I am, therefore, suspending Mr. Ali from the practice of Islam. He may no longer appear in temple, pray or teach, or have any conversation with any Muslim whatsoever. Furthermore...he may no longer use the name of Muhammad Ali. Henceforward, he will revert to his old slave name, Cassius Clay.
BELINDA => Muhammad...?
ALI => You can't call me that no more.
BELINDA => Hell, I can't. I'm defying them by talking to you. And being with you.
ALI => Whyn't you call an ambulance or a doctor?
LANDLADY =>  Wouldn't let me. Said he knew you...and to call you, Mr. Ali... He's not been out for three days...
BINGHAM => Bundini!
BUNDINI =>  Watchu' doin' here? Gimme that short dog!
ALI => What's wrong with you, man?!
BUNDINI => Nothin' wrong with me!
BUNDINI => What that?!!!
BINGHAM => A mystery...d-d-d-daylight...
BUNDINI =>  Leave me alone!
ALI => I leave you alone.   You called me!
BUNDINI => That were a week ago...
ALI => What you shame yourself like this for, maaan...?! Why you shame yourself?!
BUNDINI => Lemme alone!  I'm flyin'! The Sky Chief talk through me. I know the word!
ALI => You know "low." You so low, the curb look like up!
BUNDINI =>  Yeah? The king gotta go home to his throne! From the root to the fruit...!
ALI => Those rhymes is old.    Forget 'em.
BUNDINI =>  God don't care about you! Don't care about me! In all of everything, we mean nothin'. He don't know us. We be. And that's the onliest thing he did. And that's good 'cause that's why we free. But free ain't easy. Free is real. And realness is a motherfucker...  It eats raw meat.  It walk in its own shoes.  It does not waver...  Yeah...
BUNDINI => I sold your belt for five hundred dollars to a barber on Lenox Avenue. That's how low I did you. I'm filled with weakness and got a crazy mind. That belt say you the Heavyweight Champion of the World. Five hundred dollars and I put it into my arm. That's what I called to tell you...
BUNDINI => ...heard 'bout the Nation, all that court stuff.
ALI =>  Yeah.
BUNDINI => Forgive me, Muhammad.    Take me back...
ALI => No. There's no "back" to take you to...
ALI =>  ...you can't do what you do best in the world. And how you feed your family? From prison? Who take care of your kids? And is Allah, is God with me?
ALI => A thousand dollars to the man who brings me Howard Cosell's toupee! Dead or alive!
HOWARD COSELL =>  Don't bother me. I'm a world- famous broadcaster and you're an ex-champion with diminished skills. I can't be seen you, it would be calamitous to my reputation.
ALI => Put me on, Howard. HOWARD COSELL Muhammad, I'd do anything for you. But I got bosses who only give a damn about Nielsen ratings.
ALI => I guarantee...it will be a historical and momentous night!
ALI => ...what Heavyweight Champion of the World? I'm not the champ. I am retired, finished, out of the game. And I ain't gonna let myself grieve and suffer none. But I know I will not fight again...
HOWARD COSELL => I thought you were resolute in your resolve to regain your crown...
ALI => If tomorrow they say: "We want you to fight Joe Frazier. Madison Square Garden. Millions and millionses of dollars. Here's your license back." I will tell them: "I am sorry, but I am done."
HOWARD COSELL => What about Frazier?
ALI => You'll have to wonder...what me and Smokin' Joe would have looked like.
HOWARD COSELL => You surprise me, Muhammad...
ALI => Howard, you losing your hearing along with your hair? Don't put questions to it!  I am through fighting. 'Cause I got a bigger and more important match comin' up. The U.S. government. A heavier contender. HOWARD COSELL Do you think you're going to jail?
ALI => I don't know, but it's going to be a shocking and terrible fight. In fact, they might wish they let me stay in boxing.
HOWARD COSELL => Joe Frazier told me on this show he would knock you out.
ALI => There you go, agitatin'.  You ask Smokin' Joe what he been smokin'?! Joe Frazier even dream he can whup me? He better wake up and apologize...  But, if I WAS to jump in the ring with Joe, here's what you might see...  Ali comes out to meet Frazier, but Frazier starts to retreat; If Frazier goes back an inch farther, he'll wind up in a ringside seat; Ali swings with a left, Ali swings with a right. Frazier keeps backin', but there's not enough room. It a matter of time before Ali lowers the boom; Now Ali lands with a right, what 
ALI => a beautiful swing, But the punch lifts Frazier clean out of the ring. Frazier's still risin', but the referee wears a frown, 'Cause he can't start countin' 'til Frazier come down. And Frazier's disappeared from view. And the crowd is getting frantic. Then our radar stations pick him up. He's somewhere over the Atlantic. Who would have thought when they came to this fight, That they would witness the launching of a black satellite?
ALI => But don't wait for they fight. 'Cause it ain't never gonna happen. You only can wonder and imagine...
ALI => You want me to buy you a drink? Ali's dad sits on a crate, painting the door of a delivery truck. He looks up...Ali is there. Emotion wells up in both men. The younger "rebelistic" son, seeing his father, who is so like him. The older hep-cat who got cheated by life of his potential and promise. In this case, his boy, his boy's name, pride and reflected glory...
ALI => I don't wanna fight no more.   Not with you...
ALI => Who dress you, Joe?   You look like Dale Evans.
FRAZIER => Shut up.    Get in.
FRAZIER => What the hell you in Philly for? Philly my town.
ALI => To be closer to you, honey.
FRAZIER => Fuck you.
ALI => There be two undefeated heavyweight champions! And they ain't fighting!
FRAZIER => I wanna fight you! Said it a hundred times. The Man won't let you fight no more. What you complainin' to me for? ALI 'Cause you gotta get behind this and we gotta do this.
FRAZIER => We..."gotta" do nothin'!!!
ALI => You wanna get this on, Joe?     You and me? Or not?!
FRAZIER => What about your license?
ALI => I can fight in Atlanta.
FRAZIER => How's that? What about the Boxing Commission?
ALI => Georgia ain't got no state boxing commission. And Atlanta got a black city council; a liberal Jewish mayor, Sam something. It all set. I do a prelim in Atlanta with Jerry Quarry. But we got to get the steamroller movin' now.
FRAZIER => What I got to do?
ALI => You announce that if I beat Quarry you give me the title shot.  So what you say...maaan?
FRAZIER => My daddy was a sharecropper. I worked in a slaughterhouse...right on that corner. I came up from nothing.  What I got, I got with this. And I already got the title. So I got nothing to win and everything to lose.
ALI => But you know you ain't the champ yet.
FRAZIER =>  Yeah..."yet."  All right. You beat Quarry, I'll get inna ring and fuck you up...
FRAZIER =>  You need any money or anything to tide you by...?
ALI =>  I'm fine. Thanks.
ANGELO DUNDEE => TIME!!
ANGELO DUNDEE => Weight's comin' down. 222.
ALI => What you want?
BUNDINI => Take me back, boss.
ALI => You want me to take you back?
BUNDINI => I'm clean.  And you a resurrection. This is God's act. Anybody love poor people and little people and fucked-up people gotta be a prophet. 
BUNDINI => And the prophet is going home. You the sun. Let me live in the light.  Take me with, boss.  ...I'll do anything.
ALI =>  You can't hit what you can't see.
BUNDINI =>  Float like a butterfly, sting like a bee.
ALI/BUNDINI =>  Rumble, young man, rumble!
BUNDINI => You the man! You Superman! Ain't no kryptonite in this ring tonight!
BELINDA =>  ...you don't need their management...
HERBERT => As-Saalam Alaikum...Brother Muhammad...
ALI => All praise to Allah... (a beat, and softly...) ...Alaikum Salaam...
HERBERT =>  The Messenger has lifted the suspension, Muhammad. Congratulations.
ALI => You saying I can be a Muslim again, Herbert?
HERBERT => Yes.
ALI =>  I never stopped. Like I never stopped being champ.
HERBERT => I begged my father to reinstate you.
ALI => When? After I promoted Quarry fight? After I won it?
HERBERT => We can get you Frazier.
ALI => I already got Frazier.
HERBERT => We can get you five million dollars for Frazier.
ALI => Are we talking management, talking money or talking religion?
HERBERT => When you...
ALI =>  When I got leery and talked up how come I'm broke, then came the suspension. Now, you explain that to me, my brother...?
HERBERT => It's my father... ALI (puts a hand on his shoulder) I love the Nation, Herbert. I love Elijah Muhammad. But it don't own me.
ALI => Now, you go on out. And you make the Frazier deal.
HERBERT => My brother!
ALI => Yeah...
BINGHAM => You b-b-becoming a Christian? Forgive and forget?
HOWARD COSELL => Muhammad, you T.K.O.'ed 'em...
ALI => What are you talking about, Howard? Quarry?
HOWARD COSELL =>  No. "The Supreme Court ruled today in the case of the United States vs. Cassius Clay, a.k.a. Muhammad Ali..."  You won an 8-0 unanimous decision. You're free.
ALI => I'm free. ANGELO DUNDEE What are you talking about?
ALI => Supreme Court set me free.
BUNDINI => That's 'cause they know the king is gonna go home to his throne. And they know everybody's with you, now. And they wanna be on the RIGHT side!
ANNOUNCER => Ladies and gentlemen, fifteen rounds of boxing for the heavyweight championship of the world...
ANNOUNCER => ...the contender and former heavyweight champion of the world, seeking to regain his title, from Louisville, Kentucky, Muhammad Ali!!!
ANNOUNCER => And in the opposite corner, the current heavyweight champion of the world, Smokin' Joe Frazier...!
ALI'S EYES => deep in his focused concentration. His attention so arrow like it reminds us of the younger man in the Liston fight...pure purpose.
ALI =>  Hook's comin'. Lean back, man! Move back! WORK LEGS...!
HOWARD COSELL => Ali was out! He was out on his feet. Joe almost had him. Frazier must have thought Ali was playing possum. 'Cause Ali's a clown. Others have come in on Ali when he's playing possum and gotten knocked out.
ANGELO DUNDEE => Hell of a fight, champ...
HANGERS-ON => They stole it from you!
ALI => Shut up! I lost.  Get outta here...
RUDY => Go on!   Everybody out!
ANGELO DUNDEE =>  Ferdie, take a look at this...  It was still a hell of a fight.
ALI => Where's Belinda?
PACHECO => She fainted... They took her to the aid station. She's okay.
ALI => My hands was in sand, Angie.     My feet in water...
ANGELO DUNDEE => Maybe we shoulda had more time between Blin and this, you know...to get back into...
ALI => Woulda, shoulda, coulda...  After three-and-a-half years, this...from how far back...comeback is.
PRESS => Were you robbed?
ALI => I lost. You lose, you don't shoot yourself. The world goes on.
ANOTHER REPORTER => Joe said he didn't think you wanted to fight him again...
ALI =>  Oh, how wrong he is.
BELINDA => My God.    They killed you!
PACHECO => Get away from her.     What is that?
ALI => I ain't dead, baby!     C'mon.
ALI => I can move my jaw with my tongue. He got me...
PACHECO =>  It's broke. I think...I think your jaw's broke.
PACHECO => nods to Dundee. Dundee starts to reach. Ali snatches Angelo's hand holding the towel. Angelo's about to end the fight...
ALI => Ain't stoppin' nothin'...!  Nothin' stoppin'...!
HERBERT => Now that Smokin' Joe's run out of tomato cans to beat up, I finally got Yank to commit to a rematch with you in about six months. Frazier said he'd be happy with three mil... 
HERBERT => I'll fly to Jamaica and get Yank to sign right after Joe beats this big stiff. 
ALI =>  Foreman call me one time after he won the Olympics...
HOWARD COSELL =>  DOWN GOES FRAZIER! DOWN GOES FRAZIER!
BINGHAM =>  B-b-be easy gettin' a Frazier fight now. He ain't the champ of anything except getting knocked down.
ALI => So.
ANGELO DUNDEE => So we only eked this one out. And George Foreman makes Frazier look like a sissy.
PACHECO => You see their fight?
HOWARD BINGHAM => You mean the Joe Frazier falling- down lesson?
PACHECO => And Foreman is 24. You are 32 years old. I don't want to see your head get turned into someone's bull's-eye.
ANGELO DUNDEE => ...but, you go? We're the corner, same as always. But it ain't gonna be easy.
ALI =>  You think I still got the tools?
ANGELO DUNDEE => You got the tools, Daddy.     But they different.
ALI =>  Well, you better sharpen 'em up. 'Cause we goin' to Africa. BUNDINI The motherland. From the root to the fruit. We gonna rumble...in the jungle.
ALI => It's time to be heavyweight champion of the world again.
BUNDINI => Yeah, man!
DON KING => "Rumble in the Jungle!"     That's the name I given it.
DON KING => A historical happening. This event will show that the black man has arrived on the world stage. Muhammad Ali and George Foreman in Kinshasa, Zaire.
REPORTERS => Don. Zaire? Why not Antarctica? What's wrong with New York City?
DON KING => Because you miss the significance. I dream, as Martin Luther King once dreamt, that a man could be judged by the content of his mind. This is about black men helping black men, overcoming four hundred years of racial depression to the dawn of a new day of liberation...financial and otherwise.
DON KING => It will raise up the spirit of our inner cities. It will rise up and fill with hope the souls, the unrequited needs of the black proletariat, that is, the discouraged, dispirited, denigrated, denizens of the demimonde, that is called...the ghetto.
ALI => Man, you crazy.
DON KING => Ten million dollars. With one stroke of the pen, you split the world's biggest emolumation of the history of sports!
DON KING => The "Rumble in the Jungle"!
ALI =>  What are they saying, man?!!!    Why they saying that?
ALI =>  What?!
mobbing him. => MUHAMMAD ALI
ALI => Ali, boma ye!
ALI => Ali, boma ye!
ALI =>  Fast. Six left jabs flash from his chest and shoulder, followed by a right hook and left and right uppercuts.
ALI =>  Back up, maaan... (weaves suddenly; another voice) ...you fast!
KIDS => Ali, boma ye!
ALI =>  Ali, boma ye George Foreman!
ALI => You out, sucker! Curious, Ali runs behind the green signs from where the kids came.
TEENAGER =>  You beat them, Ali!
ALI => Foreman?   I kill him!
ALI => Shazaam!!!
ALI =>  ...even if I die here. If it kill me, no matter what...I gotta win.
ALI => Howard! How many you ugly sportswriters in there got me over Foreman? Don't lie.
HOWARD COSELL =>  Some of us...Norman, me...are worried. How you gonna dance against George?? He's sparring with a middleweight, training to cut you off. He gets you against the ropes, he can knock you out with either hand.
ALI =>  What's the odds?
HOWARD COSELL => Two-and-a-half-to-one. Against. We're worried you're going to get hurt.
ALI => This'll be the biggest upset since Sonny Liston. I want all of you to write it down! This fight is no contest!
ALI => George Foreman is a big mummy. I've officially named him "The Mummy."
ALI => George punches are like "Look out, here come the left." Whomp!  Here come the right! Whomp! Like a Mummy. But "The Mummy" can't hit what it can't see. I'm fast! Gonna dance. Be all over George. George is gonna feel he surrounded.  And I done somethin' new for this fight; I done rassled with an alligator. Anticipatory laughter. They've had twelve years' experience of Ali's stand-up and know when a new routine's starting...
ALI => That's right! (laughter again; Ali almost loses it) I have rassled with an alligator. I done tussled with a whale. I done handcuffed lightning, thrown thunder in jail. That's bad! Only last week I murdered a rock. Injured a stone. Hospitalized a brick. I'm so mean, I make medicine sick.
HOWARD COSELL => Muhammad, I'm sorry. I have to ask. (he hesitates; he's sorry, but) Are you really fast enough, anymore? To beat George Foreman? Many people believe you don't have the same skills, that you are not the same man you used to be ten years ago.
ALI => Howard. I didn't want to talk about this, especially in front of everybody. But I talked to your wife! And she told me you're not the man you used to be...two years ago!
ALI => Salaam Alaikum, brothers!  The champ is here!
BELINDA => Here's your water.
ALI => Bottled water. Frozen steaks. Brought all this stuff like Africans don't have steaks...
BELINDA => You could pick up parasites...
ALI => They eat it.
BELINDA => You're seeing what you want to see, Muhammad...
ALI => Mobutu eats it...
BELINDA => Mobutu is taking care of Mobutu and stealing all the wealth and sending it to Switzerland...
ALI =>  So? What's that do with any of why we here?
BELINDA =>  We're here 'cause Don King got Mobutu to put up ten million dollars. Don King don't give a damn about Africa. He worse than Herbert.
ALI => Here come "Herbert."
BELINDA => Yeah. 'Cause where was he when we was broke and borrowing money? And Bundini and all them that "love you"? Disappeared, is where they were.  All over you when you got it and drop off you when you don't...
ALI => Money? I do "money-making" whenever I want. Money is easy.
BELINDA =>  And Don King fit right in...that double-breasted hipster is now a dashiki-wearing rip-off.
ALI => Don King delivered the first black- promoted championship fight in Africa!
BELINDA => Don King talks black, lives white and thinks green! Why you defending him and "brother" Herbert? 
ALI => 'Cause clean-cut Muslims parading on the South Side of Chicago don't get this done! I got to put honkeys with connections and bad- ass niggers to it, too.
BELINDA =>  And now they got you up against George Foreman. Do they give a damn you could get killed?
ALI => That what this is? Think I gonna lose? Puttin' doubt on me?
BELINDA =>  I think: why is my Muslim husband letting himself get strung up on a cross...? It means, "tell me."
BELINDA => Maryum is sick. Maybe I oughta go back to Chicago and look after her.
ALI => Sure.
BELINDA => I'll be back before the fight.  If that's all right, my husband...
DON KING =>  Champ! Champ! George had an accident.
ANGELO DUNDEE =>  What are you talking about?
DON KING => Got cut. Right above his right eye. His sparring partner's elbow. Split it open, so...
ANGELO DUNDEE => Can he fight?
DON KING => Not for six weeks.
DON KING => This is not a humorous situation, my champion. This postponement could be long, especially if George leaves.
ANGELO DUNDEE => Are you tryin' to pull something, Don? Ali wants his title. And he wants it back in Zaire. George leaves, he ain't comin' back. George don't like it here.
DON KING => How right you are, my suspicious and short Italian brother. And my fiduciary responsibility to this first all-black promotion is like a garden in the African sun. It must grow! It must bloom! It cannot flower in the gloom and shade of postponement to some dome. Like the Astrodome, the Super-dome, any dome outta Zaire, where it be deprived of light and bled of water. 'Cause what gonna bleed...is money. A hemorrhage of cash.  ...blood on the floor. Double hotel costs. Double travel costs. Airplanes. Food and beverage...
ANGELO DUNDEE =>  What do you expect us to do, Don?
DON KING =>  Muhammad. Find a way to get George to stay. Be Moses in reverse: do NOT let my people go! Stay the fuck right here, in Egypt, if you'll pardon my Swahili.
BINGHAM => L-l-l-lingala.
DON KING => What?
BINGHAM => Lingala.   They s-s-s-speak Lingala.
DON KING => Who cares?
ANGELO DUNDEE =>  If George goes? You forfeit five million. You crawl back to Cincinnati. You ain't promotin' a charity raffle...
DON KING =>  If George goes? George goes, my champion, I will get you Joe Frazier. Ali-Frazier III...the fight everybody want to see.
ALI =>  Truth is...George knocked hisself out.
ALI => That's right. He did three rounds. Knew he was gonna lose to Muhammad Ali and knocked hisself out. And I predict that whenever the fight is set, he might not show up!
DON KING =>  You bad!
ALI => I'm a bad man!
DON KING => Ain't no doubt about it.
ALI => And you tell the same thing to George.
ALI =>  I been watchin' you! I heard you. I know he's your man. I know you got him picked. But the man's in trouble. 
ALI => The whole world was gonna know. But, now, he ain't gonna show. That's why he knocked hisself out when he was training.
DON KING =>  We will reschedule the fight, and to ensure George is ready, we are thinking of postponing from September 24th to October 30th.
REPORTER => What about the concert, Don? DON KING That would go off as planned on September 22nd and 23rd.
ALI =>  Uh-huh. I want all helicopters guarded! Private boats. Private jets. I want the airport -- I'm serious -- I want President Mobutu and all his paratroopers. Mobutu and all his paratroopers. I want all of you "Zaireans" to be on guard! Watch all strange boats tryin' to slip away! They might be takin' him out.
ANGELO DUNDEE => The bus station. It's Ali kidding on the square. A serious point delivered not seriously to be taken seriously.
ALI => Yeah. Watch the bus station. Watch everything! Elephant caravans. He might sneak out by elephant.
ANGELO DUNDEE => What you say?
DON KING => I ain't talkin' to you!
ALI =>  Hey!!!
ALI => Don't talk to Angelo like that! Don't you talk to him like that ever again!!!
ALI => You think you're callin' these shots, Don? You're not.
ALI =>  They know! (segues into a routine) All those ladies out there know.
ALI =>  They know I'm ready! I see fear in the eyes of his followers! I see fear! This is the fight that Muhammad Ali was supposed to be ended. The myth of Muhammad was supposed to fall! (hits the table with his fist; glares at King) Supposed to be my destruction! (French voices and laughter, understated) They miscalculated. They misjudged. They got it...wrong.
ALI => Say, girl...!
ALI => C'mere.   I know you?
VERONICA => I don't think so.
ALI => What's your name?
VERONICA => Veronica Porche.
ALI => Like the sports car.
VERONICA =>  Yes.
ALI => But with a little something extra.  Veronica, I know you now. C'mere, sit down.
ALI => You with Don?
VERONICA => Don brought me here, but I'm not "with"...anybody.
ALI => Where you from?
VERONICA => L.A. But my people are from Louisiana. We're Creole. So I'm African, French, Spanish, my mother's grandfather was Jewish.
ALI =>  Well...they all came together real nice.
VERONICA => You know...  ...I'm glad you said what you did. You made sure this fight stays here. ALI All them writers in there think Foreman gonna...kill me!  What you think?
VERONICA => Ali, boma ye.
PLIMPTON TYPE => ...she's an African "succubus." Means witch doctor.
BUNDINI => Succubus? Suck my dick. They ain't room in Africa for more than one witch doctor. And that's B'dini.
ALI => You been to Hong Kong?   Taiwan? Thailand?
VERONICA => No.
ALI => I can't go there. All the ladies out there from Indonesia, Japan, Hawaii, India... (high-pitched voice, imitating female fans) "Ali-i-i-e-e-e! Ali-e-e-e! Oh, Muhammad Al-i-i-i!" (speaks in faux foreign language, imitating female fans; to Bingham) You seen those people from Thailand? I was in Bangkok -- I couldn't walk. (laughter; hangs his head) I couldn't...I just couldn't do nothin'. "Get me outta this country!"  The women were so pretty...
BINGHAM => 'B-b-b-bout Hong Kong, man?!   You know what I heard?
ALI =>  Ladies in Thailand, their hair comes down to their knees...and they about Veronica's complexion...and they bad! 
ALI => But they ain't nothin' like the "sisters." (holds Veronica's hands, looks deep into her eyes) Ain't NOTHIN' like the sisters!
NEWS CAMERAMAN => Champ...
ALI =>  Let's go for a ride.
ALI => So why you glad we still here?
VERONICA => Holdin' this in Africa make people proud. All over the world. They're proud of you. Anybody can fight in Vegas.
ALI => That's one job.    I got two...
ALI =>  ...gotta whup George!
VERONICA => Islamic faith help you to that?
ALI => Listen, girl, as a Muslim, I am busted out and failed in the eyes of God. I shoulda discovered Islam at 50! 'Cause I am weak on women. They take my eyes and my heart follow...causing me to be a lovin' husband and a terrible husband...! (looks down at her, intensely) ...green eyes and cocoa skin...?  ...okay, rest of me, let's go!!
ALI =>  Faster! Faster!
DUNDEE =>  TIME!
HOLMES => You can't lead a right hand.   Not at him!
ALI => Why not?
HOLMES => Too long...to get it there. Man, I mean, to think you could hit him with a right lead...it's insulting... Nobody would lead a right...
BUNDINI => I got him! Lock him up.
SADLER =>  Hey, hold up, chump!   Make this chump turn me loose.
SADLER => This is my wife, Irene...
ALI => Hey! Look! Look at George Foreman's trainer, feelin' me up on purpose! On the side, to see if I'm in shape!
IRENE => Can I have your autograph?
ALI => We'll, you ain't gonna find no fat! Watch out!!
SADLER =>  Give me that thing!
BINGHAM =>  Muhammad. Give her an Ali button!
SADLER => No, you ain't.  All right, give my wife an Ali button.
ALI => She's gotta put it on.
SADLER => Give my wife one. BINGHAM Bo'dini, you got Ali buttons?
ALI => "George" buttons is all I got. In my bedroom! All over the bed! Everywhere! To remind me...of all of ya'. All of ya'! Reminds me of all ya'!
ORTF INTERVIEWER =>  Pardon. Vous tes de l'ambassade des Etats-Unis? Vous avez une prdiction?
ORTF INTERVIEWER =>  Excuse me. You are from the U.S. Embassy? Do you have a prediction?
BRADLEY =>   Je suis avec l'Agence amricane d'informations. Il ne m'est pas permis d'exprimer mes prfrences entre deux citoyens des Etats-Unis.
BRADLEY =>   I'm with the U.S. Information Agency. I'm not allowed to take favorites among two United States citizens...

BELINDA => Hello, Muhammad. Bingham.    Mr. Cosell.
HOWARD COSELL =>  Hi...Mrs. Ali.
ALI => When did you get in?
BELINDA => Just now. Muhammad, may I have a word with you, please?
BELINDA => What is going on?
ALI => You know what's going on. (it's not the first time)
BELINDA => But I don't have to have it thrown in my face. I don't have to read about it and have people call me up on the phone about it...
ALI => I didn't mean for it to come out...
BELINDA => Oh, hell, Muhammad, you got no discretion. You never did. You humiliate me!
BELINDA => I clean for you. I cook for you. I feel every punch you take.
ALI => I know that.
BELINDA => Then why you got to be visible with women?
ALI => I didn't mean for it to be...
BELINDA => I live with the casual ones. (gestures to Veronica's clothing) But this, this...I can't hold it together anymore. ALI I don't want to hurt you. It's wrong. You're a good wife to me.
BELINDA => Then why do you disrespect me this way?!
ALI => I respect you.   I always respect you.
BELINDA => Do you love her?
BELINDA => Do you want to marry her?
ALI => I follow my heart.
BELINDA => "You're following your heart"?  That's what you do. No matter what anybody says. Or thinks. Or what it does...  And what happens now?
ALI => I fight George.  I didn't come this far to quit.
BELINDA => Neither of us did.
BINGHAM => Belinda?
BINGHAM => You can't beat him. You can't beat him, 'cause you can't not love him.

ANGELO DUNDEE => It's hot. Humid. Monsoon season's about to start. May hit 140 in the ring under the lights. You all right?
ALI => Why?
ANGELO DUNDEE => Where you at?
ALI =>  Foreman ain't no mummy. He's knocked out eight out of eleven before the end of the third round. He the most dangerous fighter I ever fought.

ALI => And I can't WAIT!
LIEUTENANT NSAKALA => Three minutes!

CLAYTON => Ali, be quiet!
CLAYTON => No kidney punches. Now...
ALI =>  You been hearin' about me for years. All your life you been hearin' about Muhammad Ali. Now you gotta face me.

ALI =>  They don't know what's happenin'.
ALI =>  You bet the wrong horse! He can't fight no better than you can act!
ALI =>  Take it! Terrify him with what you can take...
ALI =>  Eight more rounds... You runnin' outta gas?
ALI =>  ...can't let you get that second wind which you don't know is out there for you. 
ALI =>  Want the title...wear the heavyweight crown?  Jaw broke? Nose smashed? Face busted? You ready to die? Is that you?  'Cause you gonna meet a man who will die before he let you win.
