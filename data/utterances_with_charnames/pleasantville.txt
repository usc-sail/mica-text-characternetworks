COLLEGE COUNSELOR => ... For those of you going on to college next year, the chance of finding a good job will actually decrease by the time you graduate. Entry level jobs will drop from thirty-one to twenty-six percent, and the median income for those jobs will go down as well ...
COLLEGE COUNSELOR => Obviously, my friends, it's a competitive world and good grades are your only ticket through. By the year Two Thousand  ...
HEALTH TEACHER => ... The chance of contracting HIV from a promiscuous lifestyle will climb to one in one hundred and fifty. The odds of dying in an auto accident are only one in twenty-five hundred.  Now this marks a drastic increase ...
SCIENCE TEACHER => ... From just four years ago when ozone depletion was at ten percent of its current level. By the time you are twenty years old, average global temperature will have risen two and a half degrees. Even a shift of one degree can cause such catastrophic consequences as typhoons, floods, widespread drought and famine.
SCIENCE TEACHER =>  Okay. Who can tell me what famine is?
MAN => Honey, I'm home.
WOMAN => Hello darling.
BETTY => How was your day?
GEORGE => Oh, swell. You know, Mr. Connel said that if things keep going the way they are, I might be seeing that promotion sooner than I thought.
BETTY => Oh darling that's wonderful!  I always knew you could do it.
GEORGE =>  Hey, Pumpkin! What's that smell?  Is that your meat loaf?
DAVID =>  "It might be ..."
BETTY =>  It might be.
GEORGE => Oh Pumpkin! You sure know the way to this man's heart.
DAVID'S MOM => ... Bullshit Barry, that wasn't the deal
DAVID'S MOM => No--you have custody the first weekend of every month and this is the first weekend ...  I don't care if yesterday was the thirtieth, this is still the first weekend.
DAVID'S MOM => No I can't bail you out, I'm supposed to go to La Costa ...  Well if I want to get a mud bath, that's really my business, isn't it?
GEORGE =>  Hey. Where are those kids?
DAVID =>  "Right behind you father."
MARYSUE => Mother ... Father ... Bud has a little surprise for you.
BETTY => What's that Bud?
BUD => First prize at the science fair. There were lots of swell projects--guess mine was just the "swellest".
BETTY => Darling that's wonderful. Except there's no such word as "swellest".
BUD => Well gee whizz, Mom. lt wasn't the "English" fair.
DAVID'S MOM => Well sure they can stay by themselves, Barry, but that's not the point. You said you'd take them.  Well fine--they'll stay by themselves then.
DAVID =>  What's a mother to do?
BETTY =>  Oh--what's a mother to do?
DAVID => Hi. I mean ...  ... Hi.
DAVID => Look. You probably don't think I should be asking you this. I mean--not knowing you well and all ...
DAVID =>  I mean I know you--everybody knows you ... I just don't know you ... technically.
DAVID => Well--I was just wondering--'cause I see you all the time in Algebra and I heard you humming that Van Halen song and I really like that song too ...  Anyhow, I don't know what you're doing this weekend but my Mom's leaving town and she said I could use her car so ...
HOWARD => Okay, whose window did Bud break when he was playing with his father's golf clubs?
DAVID => Easy. Mr. Jenkins. What JOB did Mr. Jenkins have?
DAVID => Salesman. What did Bud and Mary Sue name the cat they found in the gutter?
HOWARD => Scout?
DAVID => Marmalade.
DAVID => Okay--here's one: Why did their parents come home early from their weekend at the lake?
DAVID => 'Cause Bud didn't answer the phone and they were worried about him.
HOWARD => You're unbelievable. You'll win this thing for sure. When is it on?
DAVID => Marathon starts at 6:30. Contest's tomorrow at noon.
HOWARD =>  A thousand dollars ... And it's on all night?
DAVID => Of course it is Howard. That's why they call it a Marathon.
KIMMY => Omigod, it's so mortifying, being related to him. I can't believe you're like--
JENNIFER => Only on my parent's side.
KIMMY => I know, but you're like ... twins and stuff.  You must be from like, the cool side of the uterus.
KIMMY => Omigod, omigod--here they come.
CHRISTIN => Don't do anything. Just don't like--do anything ...
JENNIFER =>  Hi Mark.
MARK =>  Hey.
JENNIFER =>  Hey.
MARK'S LACKEYS =>  Hey.
JENNIFER'S LACKEYS =>  Hey.
MARK => Saw you at the mall yesterday.
JENNIFER => Yeah ... Saw you too.
JENNIFER => So you watching Pearl Jam on MTV tonight?
MARK => Yeah. 
JENNIFER => My mom'll be out of town.
MARK => So uh ... Maybe we could uh ...
JENNIFER =>  Cool.
MARK =>  Cool.
VARIOUS LACKEYS => Cool.
JENNIFER => ... I know, I know--He's just like so FINE ... I'm still like: "Omigod."
JENNIFER => It was amazing, Daph ... I'm like: "Well my Mom'll be out of town." And he's like "Well then, maybe we could-- you know ..." And I'm like "Yeah, sure." And he's like "Well, cool."  I know, he's just so smart.  I don't know. Maybe that black thing I just got.  It is not slutty, Daph, it's cute.  Well, "hello?" He's not coming  over here to study ...  I know. Well I'm jealous of you too sometimes.
DAVID => ... He's not homeless Howard, they just don't say where he lives.  Well it's a silly question.  Because nobody's homeless in Pleasantville.
DAVID => ... because that's just not what it's like.
DAVID => Listen Howard--it's almost six-thirty. I gotta go.
JENNIFER =>  What are you doing?
DAVID => What are you doing?
JENNIFER => David, cut it out. Mark Davis is gonna like be here in five minutes.
DAVID => Well great. The Pleasantville Marathon starts at six thirty.
JENNIFER => Pleasantville Marathon?
DAVID =>  Yeah. Every episode ever.
JENNIFER =>  Omigod, I don't be-lieeeeve this! He's gonna like beeeee here!
DAVID => Weil great. You can watch TV upstairs.
JENNIFER => Upstairs! Up-staiiirs! There isn't any STEREO!
DAVID =>  Oh my God ... (sinking to his knees/ scooping up the remains) Oh my God ...
JENNIFER => David, stop stressing, you can like-- turn it on normally ...
DAVID => No you can't, Jen! It's a new TV. It doesn't work without a remote.
JENNIFER => Oh my God! He's here!
JENNIFER =>  TV repair?
JENNIFER =>  Yeah ...
DAVID => Yeah ... Sort of ...
DAVID =>  You know, we didn't call any TV repair.
JENNIFER => You think you could do this like soon? It's almost six thirty.
DAVID =>  The Pleasantville Marathon starts at six thirty.
JENNIFER => That's not the reason. I've got a date at six thirty.
DAVID =>  ... Her father.
DAVID =>  ... Like Prince Charming.
JENNIFER => Um--hello? I've got like a social emergency here.
DAVID => Yeah ...
DAVID => McIntire's.
DAVID => No. McIntire's. Remember:  "For the very best in men's attire, Head right down to McIntire's."
DAVID => Ooomph?
JENNIFER =>  We'll take it.
DAVID =>  How much does it cost?
JENNIFER => Free?
DAVID => Hunh.
DAVID =>  Great.
JENNIFER => Lemme see that.
DAVID => No way.
BUD =>  Gee whizz, Mary Sue--why can't I borrow your transistor radio?
MARY SUE =>  I promised Betty Jane she could use it over the weekend.
JENNIFER => Do you mind. This is like the most important moment of my whole life.
DAVID => Forget it Jen, I've waited a year for this.
BUD =>  "But I told Mr. Miller I'd bring a transistor in to electric shop."
MARY SUE =>  "And I told Betty Jean she could have it for the picnic with Roy."
JENNIFER =>  God, David. Just give it to me!
DAVID =>  Get lost!
JENNIFER => YOU get lost!
DAVID =>  Oh my God.
JENNIFER => What happened?
DAVID => I'm not sure.
GEORGE =>  Hi Sport, hi Muffin ... Better get a move on, you're gonna be late for school.
JENNIFER =>  What did you do?
DAVID => I don't know.
JENNIFER =>  Uchh! Look at me?! I'm like so ... pasty!
VOICE => Psst! Over here.
JENNIFER => What happened?
DAVID =>  What the hell's going on!
BETTY => Bud. Mary Sue ... Breakfast is on the table.
DAVID => We're in Pleasantville?
JENNIFER =>  This isn't funny! I happen to have a very important date in like five minutes!
MARK DAVIS =>  ... Bitch.
JENNIFER => Noooooo!
DAVID => You--you gotta get us out of here.
DAVID => Because we don't belong!
DAVID => My name's David.
JENNIFER =>  Oh GOD ...
DAVID => Look--we appreciate it. We really do. We just--we want to go home now.
DAVID => Don't get upset.
DAVID => Where are you going ...
DAVID => WAIT A MINUTE!!
DAVID => COME BACK!!!
DAVID =>  Oh God.
JENNIFER => What's going to happen?
DAVID => I don't know ... It's not possible ...  Is it possible?
BETTY => Bu-ud ... Mary Sue ... Your breakfast is getting cold.
DAVID => It can't be possible.
BETTY => Well, come on kids. You're not going off to school without a hot breakfast inside you ...
BETTY => Forward march.
BETTY => I just love you in that sweater Mary-Sue. It's so flattering.
JENNIFER =>  Thanks.
GEORGE =>  Morning kids. Better get a move on or you're going to be late for school.
DAVID =>  I don't believe this.
JENNIFER => Neither do I.
GEORGE => Well, c'mon. Dig in.
BETTY =>  I put blueberries in them just the way you like.
JENNIFER => Actually--I'm not real ... hungry.
BETTY =>  Oh nonsense young lady. You're going to start your day with a nice big breakfast.
BETTY =>  Here. Why don't you have some waffle cakes.  And there's sausage and eggs and some good crisp bacon ...  ... And a ham steak.
BETTY => ... And of course, a nice big bowl of oatmeal.
PAT BOONE => "... Tooty fruity--oh rooty. Tooty Fruity ... Oh rooty."
PAT BOONE => "... Tooty fruity--oh rooty ..."
PAT BOONE =>  "... A wap bop a loo bop--a wap barn boom."
JENNIFER => I'm gonna hurl, David. I swear to God.
DAVID => Just take deep breaths.
JENNIFER => All that animal fat. I feel it in my pores or something.
JENNIFER => I still don't see why we're doing this.
DAVID => We're supposed to be in school.
JENNIFER => We're supposed to be at home David! We're supposed to be in color!  Oh God ...
MR. SIMPSON => Hello Bud.
DAVID => Hello Mr. Simpson.
MR. SIMPSON => Hear your Dad got a new car.
DAVID => Oh yeah. A Buick. It's swell.
JENNIFER => You know him?
DAVID => Owns the hardware store.
JENNIFER => Okay, now you listen to me! I don't know what's going on but you'd better fix it! I had a date with Mark Davis and I even bought new UNDERWEAR!
DAVID => We just gotta play along for a little while ... till that guy shows up again. Then I'll talk to him and ...
JENNIFER => Play along?
DAVID => Well, yeah. I'm ... Bud Parker and you're ... um--Mary Sue.
JENNIFER =>  No! I'm not gonna do it! If I don't dress like this for Mom I'm sure as hell not going to do it for you!
DAVID => We don't have a choice Jen. We're stuck until he comes back.
JENNIFER => Why can't we just EXPLAIN IT?
DAVID => To who?
FIREMAN => C'mere, kitty ...
JENNIFER => Oh God, we are. We're stuck in like "Nerdville".  I always knew you'd pay a price for this. I knew you couldn't be hopelessly geekridden for this long without suffering some like, really tragic consequences.  ... But it's just not fair. I mean--I'm starting to get really--popular. Debbi Russell transferred to another school and my skin's been great since March and Mark Davis is starting to come around and ...
BOY => Hello Mary Sue.
BIFF => What's all the commotion? Where's the cat?
JENNIFER => Um ... It's ...
BIFF => Ah, right ...  Well--guess I'll see ya later Mary Sue.
JENNIFER => Who's that?
DAVID => Biff Martin. Captain of the basketball team.
JENNIFER =>  Does he--you know--like "me"?
DAVID => As a matter of fact he does.
JENNIFER =>  Hunh.
JENNIFER => Those are my friends.
DAVID => Peggy Jane, Lisa Anne and Betty Jean.
JENNIFER =>  Can we do any better?
DAVID => I don't think so.
LISA ANNE =>  Mary Sue. You're gonna be late for Geography.
JENNIFER => Okay ...
MISS PETERS => Last week Class, we discussed the geography of Main Street. This week, we're going to be talking about Elm Street. Can anyone tell me one of the differences between Elm Street and Main Street?  Tommy.
TOMMY => It's not as long?
MISS PETERS => That's right, Tommy. It's not as long. Also, it only has houses. So the geography of Main Street is different than the geography of Elm Street.
MISS PETERS => Mary Sue.
JENNIFER => What's outside of Pleasantville?
MISS PETERS => What?  I don't understand ...
JENNIFER => Outside of Pleasantville ... What's at the end of Main Street?
MISS PETERS => Oh, Mary Sue. You should know the answer to that. The end of Main Street is just the beginning again.
DAVID => Wow.
COACH => That's it men. Keep it up. Big game tomorrow.
BIFF => Bud ...
BIFF =>  Hi ya Bud.
BUD => Hi ya Biff.
BIFF => Can I ask you a question?
BUD => Sure.
BIFF => Well ... If I was to ask your sister ... What I mean is, if I was to go up to Mary Sue ...
DAVID => Oh God! Are we in that episode?
BIFF => What?
DAVID => I don't believe it.
BIFF => What's the matter?
DAVID => You want to ask her out tonight, right? And then you want to give her your school pin ...
BIFF => Yeah ... How'd you know?
DAVID =>  Lucky guess.  Look, Biff ... I don't think it's a real good time for that right now ...
DAVID => What I mean is ... Mary Sue's been a little "different" lately ...
BIFF =>  She won't go out with me?
DAVID => I didn't say that. It's just that right now ...
BIFF => I don't know what I'd do if she wouldn't go out with me ...
DAVID =>  Look, I'm sure we'll work something out. I'll talk to her or something.
DAVID => Honest. It'll be fine.
JENNIFER => No way.
DAVID => One date, Jen--that's all I'm asking. If you don't go out with this guy we could throw their whole universe out of whack.
JENNIFER => It's too weird David. This place is giving me the creeps. Did you know all the books are blank?
DAVID => What?
JENNIFER => I looked in the library. They got covers with nothing inside them.
DAVID => What were you doing in a library?
JENNIFER => I got lost.  Oh here ... look at this!
DAVID => JENNIFER!
JENNIFER => Just watch. You know why those guys just get cats out of trees? 'Cause nothing burns around here, that's why! They don't need any firemen ...
DAVID => Jen, listen ...
JENNIFER =>  I like--really need a cigarette, too.
DAVID =>  I'll get us out of here. I really will. But if we don't play along we could alter their whole existence. We may never get home.
JENNIFER => You really think anybody's gonna, like, notice if I don't have a chocolate malt with this guy.
PEGGY JANE =>  You won't believe what we just heard.
LISA ANNE => Biff Martin's going to ask you out.
BETTY JEAN => And that's not all ...
PEGGY JANE => No, that's not all ...
JENNIFER => You sure I'm supposed to wear this?
JENNIFER =>  I could like kill a guy with these things.
DAVID => It's in your closet.
JENNIFER =>  I've worn some kinky stuff before ...
DAVID => He won't notice anyway.
JENNIFER => What do you mean?
DAVID => They don't notice that kind of thing.
JENNIFER => So what's the point?
DAVID => Jen please ...
JENNIFER => He-llo? I've got like three pounds of underwire here ...
DAVID => Just go with the program--hunh? I'm late for work.
MR. JOHNSON =>  Bud?
DAVID => Sorry ... I had to help my folks and then I couldn't find my hat ...
MR. JOHNSON => Oh.
MR. JOHNSON => I didn't know what to do.
DAVID => What's wrong?
MR. JOHNSON => Well--I always wipe down the counter and then you set out the napkins and glasses and then I make the french fries ...
DAVID =>  Yeah ...
MR. JOHNSON => But you didn't come so I kept on wiping.
DAVID => I'm sorry.
DAVID =>  You know, if this ever happens again, you can make the fries even if I haven't put out the napkins yet.
MR. JOHNSON => I'm so glad you're here.
DAVID => I understand.
BIFF => Oh. Mary Sue ...
DAVID =>  Peppermint shake, chocolate soda, two orders of fries and a split?
MR. JOHNSON => There aren't any cheeseburgers.
DAVID =>  What?
MR. JOHNSON => Well, usually I put out the burger and then you finish with the lettuce ...
DAVID => Listen to me!
DAVID => Do you have the lettuce?
MR. JOHNSON => ... Yeah.
DAVID => Have you cooked the burgers?
MR. JOHNSON =>  Yes.
DAVID => Well you can just put on the lettuce, finish the burger and pretend it was me doing it all along.
DAVID => Really. It's fine.
BIFF =>  I sure am glad you said you'd come out with me tonight Mary Sue.
JENNIFER =>  Well "gee whizz" Biff. I sure am glad you asked me.
BIFF => I don't know if I ever said this to you before, but, well ... I think you're just about the keenest girl in the whole school ...
JENNIFER => Really Biff? The keenest?
BIFF => Oh yeah.
JENNIFER =>  Gosh. I hardly know what to say.
DAVID => What can I get you two?
BIFF => Oh, I dunno Bud. Guess I'll have my usual cheeseburger and a cherry coke.
JENNIFER => Oh, I dunno Bud. Guess I'll just have a salad and an Evian Water.
JENNIFER => Cheeseburger it is.
BIFF => See the whole time we were in civics together, I really wanted to sit next to you--but you were always sitting between Peggy Jane and Lisa Anne.
BIFF => ... And you always seemed so smart and everything. Like that report you did on "Our Town Hall." Gosh. I didn't know what I'd talk to you about.
JENNIFER => Well, sometimes talking's over-rated. Don't you think?
BIFF => Hunh?  Oh, right ...
BIFF => So I know I haven't been steady with anybody, but I just don't want to rush it. You don't want to make a mistake with something that important.
JENNIFER => Oh, gosh no.
BIFF => I mean, there's kids that are even holding hands already but I figure there's plenty of time for that kind of thing later on. Don't you?
JENNIFER => Oh you bet.  Will you excuse me for a sec?
JENNIFER => Jesus Chirist ...
GIRL =>  "Did he give it to you ... Did he give it to you ... I bet he gave it to her ... Did he give it to you?"
JENNIFER =>  I don't think he knows how.
LISA ANNE => I bet he's gonna take her to Lover's Lane.
PEGGY JANE => I bet he is. I bet he is.
BETTY JEAN => I bet he's even gonna hold her hand!
DAVID =>  Couple of cheeseburgers and two cherry cokes.  If you need anything, I'll be right over there.
JENNIFER =>  Gee whiz "Bud", what could we possibly need when we have each other?
BIFF =>  Anyhow ... I really wanted to come over and sit next to you in civics but ...
JENNIFER => You want to get out of here?
BIFF => What?
JENNIFER => You wanna get out of here? You wanna leave?
BIFF =>  But where would we go?
JENNIFER =>  ... Lover's Lane.
BIFF =>  Lover's Lane!
JENNIFER => Yeah. Lover's Lane. You up for it?
JENNIFER => C'mon. Let's go.
DAVID => NOOOOOO!
DAVID => YOU CAN'T DO THIS JENNIFER! HE DOESN'T EXIST! YOU CAN'T DO THIS TO SOMEONE WHO DOESN'T EXIST!
DAVID =>  Thanks a lot.
BIFF => Sure is pretty.
JENNIFER =>  Oh yeah ... Gorgeous.
BIFF => To be honest Mary Sue. I didn't think you'd want to come here until we'd been pinned for a little while.
JENNIFER => Oh, Biff. You can "pin" me any time you want to.
JENNIFER =>  Or maybe I should just "pin" you.
BIFF => Oh, that's silly Mary Sue. How could you possibly pin me?
BETTY => Bud?
GEORGE => Son, what's wrong?
DAVID => Have you seen Mary Sue?
BETTY => Why no. She's still on her date with Biff ... is something the matter?
DAVID =>  No, I ... I was just ... worried about her.
GEORGE =>  Bud, your sister's a little older now and she's naturally going to start going out with boys.  ... In fact pretty soon--she's even going to get married and make someone a good little home-maker like your mother here. (smiles at Betty/ inside joke) That's IF she can learn to bake.
BETTY => Oh, George ...
GEORGE => But your sister is a fine young woman and she would never do anything for us to be concerned about.
BIFF =>  I think I better go home now Mary Sue ...
JENNIFER =>  ... Why?
BIFF =>  I think ... I might be ill ...
BIFF =>  I think something's happening to me.
JENNIFER => It's s'posed to happen, Biff.
BIFF => It is?
JENNIFER => Trust me ...
BETTY => Do you want some more cookies?
DAVID =>  Oh no ... I'm fine.
BETTY => How 'bout some Marshmallow Rice Squares?
DAVID => I'm fine.
BETTY => Now who could that be.
DAVID => Oh hi!
MR. JOHNSON => Hi there. You took off so quick. I wasn't sure if you were okay.
DAVID => Oh, yeah. Sorry. I'm fine. I just ... Had to get home early.
MR. JOHNSON => Bud ...
DAVID => Yeah ...
MR. JOHNSON =>  You know how when we close up, I close the register, then you lower the shades, then I turn out the lights, then we both lock the doors.
DAVID => Yeah ...
MR. JOHNSON =>  Well you weren't around this time so I did the whole thing myself.
MR. JOHNSON =>  Not only that, I didn't even do it in the same order. First I lowered the shades, then I closed the register.
MR. JOHNSON => Oh, hello Betty.
BETTY => Hello Bill.
DAVID =>  Well, look, thanks for coming by. I ... really appreciate it.
JENNIFER => Well gee thanks Biff. I had a really wonderful time.
BIFF => ... Me too.
JENNIFER =>  Hello Mr. Johnson.
MR. JOHNSON => Oh, hello Mary Sue.
DAVID =>  What did you do to him?
JENNIFER =>  Nothing.
DAVID => What do you mean "nothing?" That's not nothing. That's ...
JENNIFER => Relax "Bud." We had a really nice time.  ... Now I'm really tired and we gotta get up early for school in the morning so ...
JENNIFER => 'Night.
BETTY => Bud. It's 7:30 in the morning. Are you watching television?
DAVID =>  Oh no ...
COACH => Come on men. Let's go. Big game next week.
DAVID => Oh my God ...
DAVID => You can't do this, Jennifer. I WARNED you.
JENNIFER => So what's the big deal. Oh. Okay. They're like not good at basketball anymore. Like--omigod, what a tragedy.
DAVID => You don't understand. You're messing with their UNIVERSE.
JENNIFER => Well maybe it needs to be messed with. Did that ever like--occur to you?  You know, they don't want to be like this, it's just that nobody ever helped them before.
PEGGY JANE =>  "MS". How you doin'?
JENNIFER => Kewl "PJ". How you doin'?
PEGGY JANE =>  "Kewl."
DAVID => You have no right to do this.
JENNIFER => Well if I don't who will?
DAVID => They're happy like this.
JENNIFER => David, nobody's happy in a Poodle skirt and a sweater set.  You like all this don't you?
JENNIFER => I mean, you don't think it's just like dorky or funny or something ... you really like it.  Oh God! I am just so personally horrified right now ...
DAVID => I just don't think we have the right to ...
JENNIFER => David, let me tell you something. These people don't want to be geeks. They want to be "attractive." They've got a lot of potential, they just don't know any better.
DAVID => They don't have that kind of potential.
JENNIFER => Um--hello? You want to like take a look?
BOY => Wow. What kind of gum is that?
JENNIFER => I gotta go. I'm meeting Biff at the flagpole.
DR. HENDERSON => Let me see it again.
DR. HENDERSON =>  Well ... I don't think it's anything to worry about ... It'll probably just clear up by itself.  Cut down on greasy foods and chocolate. No french fries, that kind of thing. (aside/ to the Mother) It's just a "teenage" thing.
LIL RICHARD => "... Got a gal--her name is Sue. She knows just what to do ..."
LIL RICHARD => "... A wop bop a loo bop--a wop bam boom!"
DAVID => What'll it be?
BIFF =>  Gee whizz, Bud. Guess I'll just have the usual. Cheeseburger and a cherry coke.
JENNIFER => Me too. Sounds swell.
DAVID =>  Really? It seems so fattening.
DAVID => Two cheeseburgers, two cherry cokes.
MR. JOHNSON =>  There aren't any cheeseburgers.
DAVID =>  Look. I thought we talked about this, I thought we said ...
MR. JOHNSON => Oh--what's the point, Bud?
DAVID => C'mere.
DAVID => What did you say?
MR. JOHNSON => Well ... I'm not sure I see the point anymore.
DAVID => What are you talking about! You make hamburgers! That is the point!
MR. JOHNSON => No I know ... I know I do ...  But it's always the same, you know? Grill the bun, flip the meat, melt the cheese ... It never changes. It never gets any better or worse ...
DAVID => Just listen to me ...
MR. JOHNSON =>  ... Like the other night, when I closed up by myself. That was different ...
DAVID => Forget about that!
MR. JOHNSON => Oh ... Okay. (beat/ lower) ... But I really liked it.
DAVID => Look, you can't always like what you do. Sometimes you just do it because it's your job. And even if you don't like it, you just gotta do it anyway.
MR. JOHNSON => Why?
DAVID =>  So they can have their hamburgers!
MR. JOHNSON =>  You know what I really like?
DAVID =>  ... What's that?
MR. JOHNSON => Christmastime.
MR. JOHNSON => See every year on Dec 3, I get to paint the Christmas decorations in the window. And every year, I get to paint a different thing ...  One year it's the North Pole. The next I do Santa's workshop. Here I'll show you.
DAVID =>  Wow ... That's pretty good ...
MR. JOHNSON => Thanks.  But this morning I was thinking about it and I realized that I looked forward to it all year. And then I thought "Gee. That seems awfully silly. That seems like an awfully long time to be waiting for just one moment, don't you think?"
MR. JOHNSON => Well don't you?
DAVID => I think you should try not to think about this anymore.
MR. JOHNSON => Really?
DAVID => Yeah.
MR. JOHNSON => Oh. Okay. I'll try that then.
GUS => Have they ever lost before?
GEORGE => Basketball? No they sure haven't.
BOB => Just feels "wrong", that's all.
THIRD PATRON => Maybe that's where they get that saying, "can't win 'em all."
GUS => Yeah. That's a good point, Ralph. They do have that saying.
BOB => But they do win 'em all, Gus. They've always won 'em all.
GUS => Well, yeah. That's true too.
MARGE =>  ... He said it would clear up on its own if she just stayed away from fried foods and sweets ...
BETTY => Well that makes sense.
MARGE => Except it's spread to her lips now too. Oh, I don't know.
MARY =>  And you say it's just "red?"
MARGE => Well--like red, only ... "redder."
MARY => Hunh. I know what you mean. That's like the front of Bill Johnson's shop. I was going by it the other day and it looked green only "greener."
MARGE =>  Have you seen him lately? The man doesn't look like himself. I was getting my sewing machine fixed across the street and he was sitting in the window of his shop just staring. Wasn't looking at anything in particular--just staring off into space.
MARY => That is strange.
MARGE => Betty, it's your bid.
BETTY => Uh ... Seven hearts.
BETTY => Mary Sue?
JENNIFER => Yeah?
BETTY => Can I ask you a question?
JENNIFER => Sure.
BETTY => What goes on up at Lover's Lane?
JENNIFER =>  What do you mean?
BETTY => Well, you hear all these things lately. You know--kids spending so much time up there ...  Is it holding hands? That kind of thing?
JENNIFER => Yeah ...  That--and ...
BETTY => What?
JENNIFER => It doesn't matter.
BETTY => No. I want to know.
JENNIFER =>  ... Sex.
BETTY => Ah.
BETTY => What's sex?
JENNIFER => You sure you want to know this?
BETTY => Yes.
JENNIFER => Okay.
JENNIFER => You see Mom ...  When two people like each other very much ...
JENNIFER => You okay?
BETTY => Yes ...  It's just that ...
JENNIFER =>  What?
BETTY => Well ...  ... Your father would never do anything like that.
JENNIFER =>  Oh. Hmm ... (whisper/ woman to woman) Well, Mom ... there's ways to "enjoy" yourself without Dad.
GEORGE => Sweetie? You coming to bed?
GEORGE => Betty?
BETTY =>  Yeah ... I'm just going to take a bath first.
DAVID => Oh my God!
DAVID => Jesus Christ ...
DAVID => FIRE! FIRE!
DAVID =>  FIRE ... FIRE ...
DAVID =>  CAT!!!
DAVID => Right here!
FIRE CHIEF => Where is it?
DAVID => Here! Grab this nozzle.
FIREMAN => But where's the ...
DAVID => Just grab it!
DAVID =>  Okay! Now point this right at the flames--like this.
FIREMAN => Whoa!  So that's what these do.
BOB =>  ... In honor and in recognition of your heroism ...
BOB => ... And with great appreciation from the citizens of Pleasantville ...
BOB => I am pleased to present You with this special commendation, from the Pleasantville Chamber of Commerce!
GIRL => Hi Bud ...
MARGARET => That was sure swell ...
DAVID => Oh. Thanks, Margaret.
MARGARET =>  I baked you my oatmeal cookies.
DAVID =>  Oh, no ... You baked those for Whitey.
MARGARET => No. I baked them for you.
DAVID => No. You baked them for Whitey.
MARGARET =>  No. I baked them for you.
DAVID => Um ... thanks.
MARGARET => See ya.
JENNIFER =>  I had nothing to do with that fire.
DAVID =>  It's okay.
JENNIFER => Not directly anyhow ...
DAVID => It's fine.
JENNIFER =>  Um ... They like wanna ask you a question ... I didn't know how to handle it. So ...
DAVID => Sure.
DAVID => How you doin?
VARIOUS KIDS => Swell ...
BOY => How'd you know about the fire?
DAVID => What?
BOY => How'd you know how to put it out and all?
DAVID => Well--where I used to live ... That's just what firemen did.
BOY => And where's that?
DAVID =>  Um ... Outside of Pleasantville.
BOY => What's outside of Pleasantville?
DAVID => Look it doesn't matter. It's not important.
BOY => What is it?
DAVID => It's really not important.
GIRL => What's outside of Pleasantville?
MARGARET =>  C'mon. Tell us ...
DAVID =>  Well ... There are some places where the road doesn't go in a circle. There are some places where it keeps on going.
MARGARET =>  Keeps going ...
DAVID => Well--it all just keeps going. Roads ... rivers ...
2ND BOY =>  Like the "Mighty Mississippi".
DAVID => ... What?
BOY =>  "It was big 'n brown 'n kept goin' an' goin' as far you could see."
DAVID =>  I thought the books were blank?
JENNIFER => They were.
JENNIFER =>  Okay look, this like--wasn't my fault. They asked me what it was about and I like didn't remember 'cause we had it back in tenth grade, But I told them what I DID remember, and the next thing I knew the pages had filled in.
DAVID => The pages filled in?
JENNIFER => But like only up to the part about the raft, because I didn't read any farther.
2ND BOY => Do you know how it ends?
DAVID =>  Well, yeah ... I do.
MARGARET =>  So how does it end?
DAVID => Well--see ... they're both running away--Huck and the slave ... And ... They go up the river ... But--in trying to get free they sort of see that they're free already.
DAVID =>  Oh my God.
2ND BOY => Wow!
3RD BOY => Do you know this one?
DAVID => Hunh?  Oh yeah ... Well this is great.  See--Holden Caulfield is like this really lonely kid...
GUS => I don't know Phil. It's pretty strange.
PHIL => I'll say it's strange. Gettin' stranger.
PHIL => I mean goin' up to that lake all the time is one thing, but now they're going to a library! I mean what's next?
BURT => Oughtta be havin' an ice cream soda. That's where they oughtta be.
GEORGE => Want some bridge mix?
BOB => Oh, no thanks ...
GEORGE => Betty's making some pineapple kabobs ...
BOB => I'm fine--but thank you.
BOB => George, you're probably wondering why I asked if I could come over today ...
BOB => I'm sure you've noticed the same things we all have--certain "changes" going on in the town.  You know what I mean by "changes"?
GEORGE => "Changes."
BOB =>  "Changes."  And it's not just the fire or big stuff like that. It's little things.  Did you hear about Bill Miller?
GEORGE =>  No. What?
BOB => Wife wants him to get one of those new beds.
GEORGE => One of those ... big beds?
GEORGE => Oh my gosh. What's he gonna to do?
BOB => I really don't know.  Ben Miller's son just quit his job as a boxboy at the market.
GEORGE => ... How?
BIG BOB => Said he didn't want to do it anymore. Just took off his apron in the middle of an order. Mrs. Thompson had her groceries spread all over the counter ... Took 'em four hours to sort the whole thing out.
GEORGE => Holy cow.
BIG BOB => George, everyone likes you.
GEORGE => Oh well ...
BOB => No. They do. And it isn't just 'cause you're a great bowler ... They respect you ...
GEORGE =>  Thank you very much.
BOB => And it's important for them to see someone they respect, stand up for what's right. If you love a place, you can't sit around and watch this kind of thing happen to it.
GEORGE => No. Of course not.
BOB =>  And that's why I want you to be on the Pleasantville Chamber of Commerce.
GEORGE =>  Oh my Gosh. I hardly know what to say.
BOB =>  Why don't you start by saying "yes," and then getting me one of those swell pineapple kabobs.
GEORGE => Oh sure ... You bet.  Betty ...
GEORGE =>  BETTY ...
GEORGE => BETTY--BOB WANTS TO TRY ONE OF YOUR GREAT HORS D'OEUVRES ...
DAVID => I'll get her.
DAVID =>  Are you okay?
DAVID => Are you alright?
BETTY =>  What am I going to do?
DAVID => It's okay. It's alright.
BETTY =>  I can't go out there. How can I go out there?
BETTY =>  Look at me ...
DAVID => Have you got any make up?
BETTY => In my handbag.
DAVID => Okay--first we'll dry you out a little.
BETTY =>  What?
BETTY =>  Does it look okay?
DAVID => Looks just like it did.
BETTY => And they won't be able to tell?
DAVID =>  No ... They won't be able to tell.
DAVID => Wait.
BETTY =>  What?
DAVID => It's fine.
BETTY => Thank you.
DAVID =>  Sure.
MR. JOHNSON => Oh, hi.
DAVID =>  Hi.
MR. JOHNSON => Aren't you a little early?
DAVID =>  I brought you something ... From the library.
DAVID => It's an art book.
MR. JOHNSON => Oh my Gosh, Bud ...
DAVID => Open it.
DAVID => I just thought since you liked painting it might help to ...
MR. JOHNSON => Mmmmgh ...
MR. JOHNSON => It's beautiful, Bud ...
DAVID => What's wrong?
MR. JOHNSON => I'll never be able to do that.
DAVID => Oh, well--you're just starting out. I mean, you can't do it ...
MR. JOHNSON => No, that's not it.
MR. JOHNSON => Where am I going to see colors like that?
MR. JOHNSON => Must be awfully lucky to see colors like that. I bet they don't even know how lucky they are.
DAVID => Hi.
MARGARET =>  Oh ... Hi.
DAVID =>  Look, I probably shouldn't be asking you this--not knowing you that well and all ...
DAVID => It's just that my folks are gonna stay home and they said I could use their car. (moment of truth/ abandoning his speech) ... You want to go out with me tonight?
MARGARET =>  Sure ... Where would we go?
DAVID =>  ... Lover's Lane?
DAVID =>  Sorry ...
DAVID => "Oh when the Saints ... Go Marching in ..."
MAN => Bud ...
MAN => David ...
DAVID =>  ... Hi.
DAVID =>  I can't.
DAVID => Talk about it. Right now, I mean. I got to ... um ...
DAVID => Oh ... I do. Yeah. It's just that I told my "dad" I'd clean out the rain gutters and Mr. Johnson wanted me to ... to change the tape in the register ...
DAVID => Re-runs?
DAVID => Oh, I know they're not. But I mean-- they're just "cookies" after all ...
DAVID => Well they're not just cookies. I mean, they're great cookies ... Look, I'd love to get into this whole thing but I'm really running late. Why don't we hook up tomorrow?
DAVID => Terrific. I'll talk to you then.
JENNIFER => What's wrong?
DAVID => Nothing.
JENNIFER => Nothing?
DAVID => Listen ...
DAVID => You're reading?
JENNIFER =>  Yeah. Can't believe you started such a dorky fad.
JENNIFER => D.H. Lawrence. You ever heard of him?
DAVID =>  ... Yeah.
JENNIFER => Seemed kinda sexy. Look. I read 35 pages.
DAVID =>  That's great.
JENNIFER => So what is it?
DAVID => Well ... I just ...  Can I ask you a question?
JENNIFER => Sure.
DAVID => Remember when you told me that Lisa Rosenberg liked me?
JENNIFER => Yeah ...
DAVID => Well--did she really like me or were you just making that up.
JENNIFER => No. She really liked you.
DAVID => You weren't playing a joke? She woulda gone out with me?
JENNIFER => Gone out with you. She woulda like rearranged your tonsils.
DAVID => Wow.
JENNIFER => Can I ask you a question?
DAVID => Yes.
JENNIFER => How come I'm still in black and white?
DAVID =>  What?
JENNIFER => Well I've had like ten times as much sex as these girls and I'm still like this. They have one hour in the back of a car and suddenly they're in technicolor.
DAVID => Oh, I don't know. Maybe ...  ... it's not just the sex ...
JENNIFER =>  What?
JENNIFER => No, it's not just the sex, is it?
MARGARET => Um ... You gotta turn off Main Street.
DAVID => Oh ... Right.
DAVID => Wow.
SAM COOKE =>  "Cupid, draw back your bow ..."
DAVID => What's that smell?
MARGARET => Aren't these great?
MR. JOHNSON => We're closed right now ...
MR. JOHNSON => Oh, hi ...
BETTY =>  I'm sorry ...
MR. JOHNSON => No, no ... Come on in.
BETTY => I just thought ... It's beautiful.
MR. JOHNSON => Thanks.
MR. JOHNSON => I was just trying to do one of these "still lifes."
MR. JOHNSON => Having kind of a tough time.
BETTY => I think it looks nice.
MR. JOHNSON => Well ...  Here's what it's s'posed to look like.
BETTY => Oh my ...
MR. JOHNSON => Here. Look at this.
BETTY =>  Where'd you get this?
MR. JOHNSON => Bud brought it to me.
BETTY => Bud?
MR. JOHNSON => Here's my favorite.
MR. JOHNSON => What do you think?
MR. JOHNSON => Isn't it great how she's resting like that?
BETTY =>  She's crying.
MR. JOHNSON => What?
BETTY => She's crying.
MR. JOHNSON => No she's not.
BETTY => Yes she is.
MR. JOHNSON =>  Wait ...
BETTY => I've got to go ...
MR. JOHNSON => It's alright.
MR. JOHNSON => It's alright. Let me see.
BETTY =>  No ...
MR. JOHNSON => It's beautiful.
MR. JOHNSON =>  ... It's beautiful.
MR. JOHNSON => You shouldn't cover that up.
JENNIFER =>  Hunh.
BIFF => Mary Sue--C'mon ...
JENNIFER =>  What are you doing?
BIFF =>  It's six-thirty ...
JENNIFER => So.
BIFF => We were gonna ... You know ...
JENNIFER => Oh.  I can't.
BIFF => Why not?
JENNIFER => I'm busy.
BIFF =>  With what?
JENNIFER =>  I'm studying.
DAVID =>  Mmmmgh.
MARGARET => Do they have those ... Where you come from?
DAVID => Yeah ... I guess.  I don't know.
MARGARET => You don't know?
MARGARET => So what's it like?
DAVID => What?
MARGARET =>  Out there.
DAVID => Oh. don't know ... It's different.
MARGARET => How?
DAVID => Well it's louder ... And scarier I guess ... And ... and a lot more dangerous ...
MARGARET => Sounds fantastic. You know some kids came up here the other night to go swimming--took off all their clothes.
MARGARET => Do they have an Ocean? I've heard about the ocean.
DAVID => Yeah.
MARGARET => What's that like?
DAVID => Well it's big. And it's blue ...  ... It's really really blue.
MARGARET => Mmmm.  Boy. It's hot up here.
MARGARET => You want some berries?
DAVID => Hunh?
MARGARET => I picked them myself. They grow wild up here.  Mmm. So sweet.
DAVID =>  They just grow like that?
MARGARET =>  Oh yeah. There's a lot of stuff. Currants and strawberries ... Here. I'll show you.
MARGARET => Here.
MARGARET => Go on. Try it.
GEORGE => Honey--I'm home.
GEORGE => Honey--I'm home ...
BETTY =>  What is that?
MR. JOHNSON => I don't know.
MARGARET => What is that?
MARGARET => What's going on?
DAVID => Rain.
MARGARET => Real rain?
DAVID => Yeah ... You don't have rain either?
DAVID => Right. Of course you don't ...
MARGARET => What do we do?
DAVID =>  We'll just put up the top.
MARGARET => What top?
DAVID => It's fine. Come on.
DAVID => It's alright. There's nothing to be afraid of.
JENNIFER => Cool ...
GEORGE =>  Honey, I'm home ...
GEORGE =>  Where's my dinner?
GEORGE => Where's my dinner ...
GEORGE =>  Where's my DINNER ...
GEORGE => Where's my DINNER!
GEORGE =>  WHERE'S MY DINNER ...
GEORGE => ... WHERE'S MY DINNER! WHERE'S MY DINNER!
GEORGE =>  Where's my dinner?
BOB => What happened?
BOB => Are you alright?  What is it?
GEORGE =>  Rain.
BOB =>  Real rain?
BOB => Oh my God ...
BOB => ... We had no idea. Burt was rolling a 250 and ...  Are you alright?
BOB => What happened?
GEORGE =>  Well, I ... I came home like I always do, And I came in the front door. And I took off my coat. And I put down my briefcase and I said "Honey. I'm home."
GEORGE => ... Only no one was there.
GEORGE => So I went into the kitchen and I yelled it again. "Honey--I'm home." But there was no one there either. No wife. No lights. No dinner.
GEORGE => So I went to the oven--you know-- because I thought maybe she had made me one of those "TV dinners ..."
GEORGE => But she hadn't. She was gone.
BOB =>  ... It's gonna be fine George.
GUS => What do we do Bob?
BOB => Well--we'll be safe for now--thank goodness we're in a bowling alley-- but if George here doesn't get his dinner, any one of us could be next. It could be you Gus, or you Burt, or even you Phil ...
BOB =>  ... That's real rain out there gentlemen. This isn't some little "virus" that's going to "clear up on it's own." There's something happening to our town and I think we can all see where it comes from.
BOB => We're gonna need a town meeting. Phil, how fast can you turn around a leaflet in your print shop?
PHIL => Couple of hours.
BOB => Gus, why don't you get a bunch of kids from the basketball team to help you put them up on lamposts and tree trunks ...
BOB =>  And the first thing you're gonna do is get a cup of hot cocoa and a nice dry bowling shirt.
MR. JOHNSON => You can't go out there.
BETTY => But I really should get home.
MR. JOHNSON => But you can't go out there.
BETTY => Sounds nice ... Once you get used to it.
MR. JOHNSON =>  Yeah. It does.
BETTY => Like a drum.
MR. JOHNSON => Yeah.  Or like sprinklers in the summer ...
MR. JOHNSON =>  Oh my Gosh ...
MARGARET =>  Oh my God ...
JENNIFER =>  Oh my God ...
BOB =>  Oh my GOD!
BETTY => I told you where I was.
GEORGE => All night?
BETTY => I got caught in the storm. You were gone all night too.
GEORGE =>  I was in a bowling-alley.
GEORGE =>  Look. Let's just forget about it. Let's just go to the meeting and ...
BETTY => I told you, George. I'm not going.
GEORGE =>  Sure you are.
BETTY => No I'm not.
BETTY => Look at me George. That meeting's not for me. Look at my face.
GEORGE => It's fine. You'll put on some make up and ...
BETTY => I don't want to put on some make up ...
GEORGE =>  It goes away ... It'll go away.
BETTY =>  I don't want it to go away.
GEORGE =>  Okay--now you listen to me ...  You're gonna come to this meeting and you're gonna put on this make up, and you're gonna come home at six o'clock every night and have dinner ready on this table.
BETTY =>  No I'm not sweetie.
BETTY =>  ... There's a meatloaf in the fridge. You just put it in the oven and turn this little knob up to three-fifty. If you put the pie in forty minutes later, it'll be hot in time for dessert.
BETTY => I made a couple of lunches for you and put them in brown paper bags ...  I'm gonna go now.
GEORGE => Where are you gonna go?
BETTY => I'm gonna go now.
GEORGE => Betty, don't go out there like that! They'll see you!  They'll SEE you!
GEORGE => Betty, come back here!
BOB => This was found over in Dave Murphy's trash can. There were four of them like this ...
BOB => Jane Davidson found these in her son's laundry basket.
BOB => This is from Mary Petersen's front porch. She found one last week. There were two more this morning ...
DAVID =>  I got you something.
MARGARET => It's beautiful. Where'd you get it?
DAVID => It was a prop for the school play ...
MARGARET => Can I open it?
DAVID => Sure ...
DRIVER => Hello Bud ...
DAVID =>  Hello Whitey.
WHITEY =>  Hello Margaret.
MARGARET => Hello Whitey ...
WHITEY =>  Hey Bud, how come you're not at the town meeting right now?
DAVID =>  No reason. (pause/ firing back) How come you're not?
WHITEY => Oh. We're s'posed to go out and let everybody know about it. See.
WHITEY => No reason hunh ... See I thought maybe it was cause you were too busy entertaining your colored girlfriend.
DAVID => Why don't you guys just get the hell out of here.
WHITEY => Oh, okay, Bud. We'll do that.
WHITEY =>  You know Margaret, you can come over and bake those Oatmeal cookies for me anytime you want to.
DAVID => It's fine ... It doesn't mean anything.
WOMAN => Ed McFadden's got a blue front door.
ED MCFADDEN => It's always been blue!
WOMAN => Not that blue!
MAN => There's a big tree turning orange in Joe Baker's front yard!
BOB => People, people ... I think we all know what's going on here.
BOB => Obviously certain "changes" have been happening. Up until now, things in Pleasantville have always been-- well ... "Pleasant." And, recently, certain things have become ... "Un-Pleasant." Now it seems to me the first thing we have to do is to separate out the things that are pleasant, from the things that are "Un-Pleasant."
BOB => George, why don't you and Burt take the lead on this. Why don't you put together kind of an "Un-Pleasant" Activities Committee ...
DAVID =>  Oh--well ...
DAVID =>  What do you mean?
DAVID => Look--it just sort of "happened" ...
DAVID => I had nothing to do with that.
DAVID => Look ...
DAVID =>  ... Only if they mean it.
DAVID =>  I didn't do anything wrong.
DAVID => Why?
DAVID => No you're not.
DAVID =>  I'm sorry ... I can't let you do that.
DAVID =>  I'm going to leave now.
DAVID =>  Come on!
DAVID => COME ON!
DAVID => Get out of here!
DAVID => Are you alright?
DAVID =>  What?
DAVID =>  Come on.
DAVID => Oh my God.
DAVID => Are you alright? Are you okay?
BETTY =>  No. Let's get out of here.
DAVID => We should be okay up here.
DAVID =>  We better go.
MARGARET => Where are they?
DAVID => I'm not sure.
DAVID => Oh my God.
JENNIFER => Don't! Just let go.
BIFF => It's better, Mary Sue.
JENNIFER => I said, NO!  ... I've read like one book in my whole life and I'll be damned if I let you throw it on that fire ...
DAVID =>  It's okay. It's me.
DAVID => Let's go inside.
DAVID => Hello?
MR. JOHNSON => Just thought I'd try to tidy it up a bit.
MR. JOHNSON => It's okay. Once we sweep it up it'll be alright again ...
DAVID => Well he's right. Come on. Let's turn these booths back up. "Mary Sue", why don't you help me slide this in front of the door. We'll be okay in here.
BOB => This is not the answer people.
BOB => No matter how upset we may get, or how frustrated we may be, we're not gonna solve our problems out in the street. It's just the wrong way to do it. We have to have a "Code of Conduct" we can all agree to live by.
BOB => Now, I asked George and Burt here to sketch out some ideas-and I think they've done a terrific job. (beat/ scans the crowd) If we all agree on these then we can take a vote and I think we'll start to move in the right direction.
BOB =>  "ONE: All public disruption and acts of vandalism are to cease immediately."
BOB => "TWO: All citizens of Pleasantville are to treat one another in a courteous and "pleasant" manner ..."
LISA ANNE => "Courteous and Pleasant manner." That doesn't sound too bad.
DAVID =>  "THREE: The area commonly known as Lover's Lane as well as the Pleasantville Public Library shall be closed until further notice."
DAVID => "FOUR: The only permissible recorded music shall be the following: Pat Boone, Johnny Mathis, Perry Como, Jack Jones, The marches of John Phillips Souza or the Star Spangled Banner. In no event shall any music be tolerated that is not of a temperate or "pleasant" nature."
VARIOUS KIDS =>  "Oh my gosh ... No ..."
DAVID => "FIVE: There shall be no public sale of umbrellas or preparation for inclement weather of any kind."
DAVID => "SIX: No bedframe or mattress may be sold measuring more than 38 inches wide."  "SEVEN: The only permissible exterior paint colors shall be BLACK, WHITE or GRAY, despite the recent availability of certain alternatives."
DAVID => "EIGHT: All elementary and high school curriculums shall teach the "non-changist" view of history-- emphasizing "continuity" over "alteration."  Wow.
BOY => Hey. This thing works.
BUDDY HOLLY => Well all the things that you say and do Make me want to be with you-oo-oo ...
LISA ANNE =>  Turn that off!
LISA ANNE =>  You're not allowed to do that now!
DAVID => Sure you are.
BUDDY HOLLY => The little things that you say and do Make we want to be with you-oo-oo ... RAVE ON! It's a crazy feeling ... RAVE ON! It's got me reelin' ...
DAVID =>  Stick together till you get off Main Street.
DAVID => It's okay. We'll get you a new one.
MR. JOHNSON =>  I don't know what I'd do if I couldn't paint anymore Bud. I just don't know what I'd do ...
DAVID => Maybe I have an idea.
BOB =>  Did you do this?
DAVID =>  Yes I did.
BOB => Do you know that it's illegal?
DAVID =>  Yes I do.
BOB => BUD--WHY DID YOU DO THIS?
DAVID => Because anybody should be able to paint in whatever color they want.
BOB => You're not allowed to do this! I could arrest you for this.
DAVID => Still doesn't make it right.
BOB => Dan! Arrest them!
DAN =>  Um ... I don't know how to do that, Bob.
BOB => What do you mean!?
DAN => Well, I never had to do it before.
BOB => You put handcuffs on them and you take them to the police station.
DAN =>  Oh. guess I could do that, then.
DAVID =>  C'mere, Dan. I'll help you.
DAN => There's someone to see you Bud.
DAVID => I thought it might be you.
DAVID => I am actually ... Glad to see you've finally shown your true colors.
DAVID => Why?
DAVID =>  Why don't you just take me back without it?
DAVID => So ... I guess as long as I'm here, all sorts of things could happen to this place. We could have pink lawns and blue trees ...
DAVID => I'm sorry. I can't do that.
DAVID => They weren't my memories.  I borrowed them. It's no good when you borrow them.
DAVID =>  I don't know ... Three, four weeks.
DAVID => I'm going on trial tomorrow?
DAVID =>  There's worse places.
BOB => Bud Parker and William Johnson, you have been charged with desecration of a public building and the intentional use of prohibited paint colors in violation of the Pleasantville Code of Conduct and laws of common decency. Do you admit that on the night of May 1, you did consciously and willfully apply the following FORBIDDEN colors to the Pleasantville Town Hall:  Red, Pink, Vermillion, Puce, Chartreuse, Umber, Blue, Aqua, Ox Blood, Green, Peach, Crimson, Yellow, Olive and Magenta.
DAVID => Um ... Yes I do. Where's our lawyer?
BOB => We prefer to keep these proceedings as "pleasant" as possible. I don't think a lawyer will be necessary.
BOB => Do you further admit that this was done surreptitiously and under the cover of darkness?
DAVID => Well--it was dark out ...
BOB => Good. Do you further admit that this unnatural depiction occurred in full public view where it was accessible to, and in plain sight of, minor children?
DAVID => It was accessible to everyone.
BOB => Very well. Let the record show that the defendants have answered in the affirmative to all the charges.
BOB => Do you have anything to say in your defense?
MR. JOHNSON => I didn`t mean to hurt anybody. I just have to paint ... I need to.
DAVID => I think I've got something to say.
BOB => Very well ...
DAVID => I think I know why you're doing this. I mean, I understand why you're doing this. I used to feel the same way. I used to want this place to stay just the way it was. I never wanted it to change ...
DAVID =>  But nothing stays the same. You get things, and you lose things, and that's the good part and the bad part--but you can't have a good part without a bad part.
DAVID => It's like the basketball team.
BOB =>  The basketball team?
DAVID => Sure. Everybody's upset because they're not winning anymore--but just think how it would feel if all of a sudden they do win.
DAVID => Wouldn't it feel better than when they used to win all the time?
DAVID => See, I know you want it to stay "Pleasant" but there are so many things that are so much better: like Silly ... or Sexy ... or Dangerous ... or Wild ... or Brief ...  And every one of those things is in you all the time if you just have the guts to look for them.  Look at those faces back there. They're no different than you are. They just happened to see something inside themselves that you don't want to ...
BOB => Okay--that's enough!
DAVID => I thought I was allowed to defend myself.
BOB => You're not allowed to lie.
DAVID => I'm not lying ... Here I'll show you.
DAVID => Mr. Simpson ...
MR. SIMPSON => Yes.
DAVID => What color is that hedge of yours?
MR. SIMPSON => Green.
DAVID => No, not that hedge. The other one.
MR. SIMPSON => The other one?
DAVID => The one in your mind. The one that you see on a bright cold morning. The one that you see when you walk in front of your house and you just stand there and stare.
DAVID => What color is that hedge?
BOB => I said, that's enough!
DAVID => Alright. Dad ...
GEORGE =>  Yes Bud.
DAVID =>  Don't you miss her?
DAVID => I mean, of course you do, but it isn't just the cooking or the cleaning that you miss--it's something else, isn't it ...
DAVID =>  Maybe you can't even describe it. Maybe you only know it when it's gone. Maybe it's like there's a whole piece of you that's missing too.  You might even call it "love."
BIG BOB =>  Okay, that's IT!!!
DAVID =>  Now don't you think she looks just as pretty in color? Don't you think she looks just as pretty as she did the day you met her?
DAVID => Don't you wish you could tell her that?
BOB =>  YOU'RE OUT OF ORDER!
DAVID => Why am I out of order?
BOB => BECAUSE I WILL NOT ALLOW YOU TO TURN THIS COURTROOM INTO A CIRCUS!
DAVID => Well I don't think it's a circus. And I don't think they do either.
BOB => THIS BEHAVIOR WILL STOP AT ONCE.
DAVID => But see that's just the point. It can't stop at once. Because it's in you. And you can't stop something that's in you.
BOB =>  It's not in ME.
DAVID => Oh sure it is.
BOB => No it isn't.
DAVID =>  What do you want to do to me right now?
