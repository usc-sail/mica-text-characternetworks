LORNA => Terri.  Why did you let me sleep so late?
LORNA => She probably forgot what day it is, right Arthur?  Some friend she turned out to be.  Not like you.  You remember what day it is, don't you?
CUT TO => OMITTED
LORNA => Hmm.  Simon and Garfunkel hit.  Eight letters.  Any thoughts?
LORNA => Excuse me, whatever happened to that sign, the one that used to hang next to the pies?
WAITRESS => What sign?
LORNA => The one that said, "Today is the first day of the rest of your life."
WAITRESS => That thing?  We got rid of it.
LORNA => Oh.
WAITRESS => Have you decided?
WOMAN => She'll have the steak and egg special.
TERRI => Look at her, she needs protein.  Lots of protein.
LORNA => 
LORNA => Working early today, huh?
TERRI => No, I had something important to do...
TERRI => ...Miss nineteen.
LORNA => I knew you'd remember.
TERRI => Of course I remembered.  Go on, open it.
LORNA => No, no.  I wasn't born until ten minutes before midnight.  And that's when I'll open it.
TERRI => You better like it.  I don't want to tell what I had to do to pay for it.
LORNA => Ooh.  It must be good.
TERRI => So what's the plan, Stan?  Something special today?  Other than splurging on toast.
LORNA => Yes.  There is something.
TERRI => Good.  Count me in.
LORNA => No.  Something big.  Something I've been thinking about for a long time.
LORNA => I can't do this forever, Terri.  Look...
LORNA => Crow's feet!  I'm nineteen!  Crow's feet!  I know I keep talking about it, but this time I'm going to do it.  In fact, I did it. This is my last day.
TERRI => Okay...
LORNA => I called them.  I told them I was out.
TERRI => You did not.
LORNA => Uh-huh.  I have one more appointment.  Then, I'm...free.
TERRI => Give me your cell phone.  I'm calling them back right now.
LORNA => A bus ran over it.  Isn't that perfect?  It's a perfect sign.
WAITRESS => 
TERRI => I know, I know.  I'm not going to light the damn thing.
LORNA => Look, I'm good for next month's rent.
TERRI => What, you're leaving too?
LORNA => Maybe.  Get out of town for a while.  I really feel good about this.
TERRI => I wish you'd talked to me first.
LORNA => I didn't because...I knew you'd try to talk me out of it.
TERRI => That's because I'm looking out for you.  It's because there is so much opportunity here.
LORNA => I know.
LORNA => Thanks.
TERRI => Well...Happy Birthday.
WAITRESS => Your friend comin' back?
TERRI => Hard to say.
CUT TO => We're in --
TODD => Seventy-five, right?  For the half-hour.
LORNA => Not including tip.
TODD => And, typically, the size of the tip is...
LORNA => Depends on how generous you feel.
TODD => Of course.
LORNA => Is...this your first appointment?
TODD => No.  I've done this before.
LORNA => Come over here, you're making me nervous.
LORNA => So, how much extra do you feel like spending?
TODD => I don't know.  Another fifty dollars?
LORNA => Uh-huh.
LORNA => So, this is what you do.  Weddings.
TODD => It pays the rent.
LORNA => These are good.  You're really a good photographer.
TODD => Well, somebody thinks so.  I get a lot of work.
LORNA => And you can only spend another fifty on me?
TODD => You have a great smile, do you know that?
LORNA => Yeah, I've heard.
TODD => And I like your name.  Lorna.  Like the cookie.
LORNA => Gee, I've never hear that one before.
TODD => Hey, I'm not afraid of sick images.  In fact, it's what I aspire to do, create pictures that are edgy, that really assault you, that reach out and slap you in the face.
LORNA => Why?
TODD => Well...I don't know.  Shake people out of their...complacency. Your friend would understand.  What's her work like?
LORNA => She photographs people pissing on each other.
TODD => Uh-huh.
LORNA => Yeah...disgusting.
TODD => Maybe that's the point.
LORNA => But who would want to look at that?  I mean, bathrooms have doors for a reason.
TODD => What do you like?
LORNA => I like things that make me happy.  Like this.
LORNA => I bet she's going to have a very happy life.
LORNA => I don't think I'm the marrying kind, though.
TODD => Me, neither.  Marriage, it's so...medieval.  Sometimes when I'm doing a wedding I look at the bride and groom and think, "What a couple of lemmings."
LORNA => I'm not sure people can be true, that's all.
TODD => Right.  That, too.
LORNA => Well...Now that we've gotten to know each better, maybe we should get started.
LORNA => Oh, you really have a big cock...My, you really have a big cock...God, what a big cock you have.
LORNA => As she goes about her work, Lorna wears a vaguely puzzled expressions. In fact, puzzles are on her mind.
LORNA => Forty-two across...Simon & Garfunkel hit...eight letters...begins with 'I'...I...I'm A Loser...Did they sing that?...Susie used to play Mom's Simon & Garfunkel records all the time...I scratched one once and she pulled my hair...I haven't spoken to her for almost a year...Her little kid must be walking by now...Maybe I should give Susie a call...Nah, fuck that!  She's perfectly capable of calling me...I mean, I'm listed...I'm...I am a rock...that's it!...I Am A Rock, that's the answer...I am a--
LORNA => 
LORNA => Wow.  That was something.
TODD => Yeah...was it?
LORNA => Let me tell you...that was something.
TODD => Really.
LORNA => Cut the modesty.  You really know what you're doing.
LORNA => 
LORNA => 
TODD => Nothing.  Are you alright?
LORNA => I'm fine.  The cab fare will be another twenty.
TODD => You never said anything about cab fare.
LORNA => Of course I did.  Are you calling me a liar?
TODD => No.  I swear, you didn't say a word about it.
LORNA => 
TODD => You haven't told me where we're going yet.
LORNA => Make a right at the light.
TODD => Can I ask you a question?
LORNA => Go on, ask.
TODD => Well, after we...after we did it, you didn't really mean what you said, did you?  About me being so good.
TODD => 
LORNA => Pull over.
TODD => What?
LORNA => Pull over here.
LORNA => You see that hotel?  In one of those rooms, there's a man waiting...he's waiting for me.  I don't know what his name is or what he looks like.  He may have bad skin.  He may be really ugly.  But no matter how he looks, or how bad he smells, or whether he makes weird wheezing sounds when he comes, I tell him the same thing...the same thing I told you.
TODD => Right...Well, that's what I thought.  I mean, a guy would have to be pretty lame to think that...
LORNA => To think what?
TODD => Nothing.
LORNA => It's Todd, right.
TODD => Yeah.
LORNA => Well, Todd, you're alright.
TODD => If I wanted to see you again--
LORNA => No. You can't.  You can't see me again.
TODD => Lorna!  Lorna!
CUT TO => OMITTED CUT TO
PHIL => 
TODD => Of course.
PHIL => And how much did this afternoon delight set you back?
TODD => Oh.  About a buck and a quarter.
PHIL => Since when do you have a hundred and twenty-five dollars to throw away?
TODD => I'm sure you spend just as much on porn rentals.
PHIL => There's no comparison.  Here, I'll do the math for you.
TODD => You're right.  I can't argue with that.
PHIL => Anyway, I stopped watching porno.
TODD => You did?  Why?
PHIL => They kinda depress me.
TODD => What?
PHIL => My imagination.
LATER. => The couple is gone.  Phil and Todd wrap some equipment.
TODD => What's Sarah got to do with it?
PHIL => You're seeing her, aren't you?
TODD => Sarah...that's a whole different situation.
PHIL => But you're doing it with her, right?
TODD => I like Sarah a lot.  And I don't want to blow it by pushing too hard.
PHIL => You mean, you haven't...
TODD => Technically?  No.
PHIL => She won't put out?
TODD => No, no, no.  You don't get it.  You can't equate the two.  What I did with Lorna--
PHIL => Lorna?
TODD => That's her name.  Lorna.  I mean, that's the name she gave me. What I did with her...that was like going to some exotic place. For a visit.    Haven't you ever wondered what that kind of person is like?  What that world is like?  I was just...doing research.  The lower depths...
PHIL => I didn't say anything.
CUT TO => OMITTED CUT TO
SARAH => Shit!  Sold out!
SARAH => I am so sorry.
TODD => That's alright.  I hear it's really overrated.  And long.
SARAH => I could just kill him!  This is not the first time he's done this, either.
TODD => Done what?
SARAH => Cooked up some phony emergency, right as I'm getting on the elevator.
TODD => He's your boss.  Being an asshole is part of the job description.
SARAH => We're talking about the most self-centered man I have ever met. God forbid I should have a life, right?
TODD => Do what?
SARAH => Ruin my evening.  Our evening.
TODD => Sarah.  Take a breath.
SARAH => Okay.  I'm taking a breath.
TODD => Now, take another one.
SARAH => I like you.  Have I told you that?
TODD => Not today.
SARAH => You know what I want to do?  I want to go shopping.
TODD => Shopping?  For what?
SARAH => For a house.
TODD => 
SARAH => Look at the detail on that one.  Wow.  Every one of these is a gem.  Makes the stuff I work on look pretty shabby by comparison.
SARAH => What's this?
SARAH => Obviously, not for me.
TODD => Something...somebody left in front the studio.  I just picked it up.
TODD => What are you doing?
SARAH => Maybe we can find out whose it is.
SARAH => 
TODD => Stupid of me...I should've left it.
SARAH => Lorna.  That's a name you don't hear very much.  Lorna.  Like the cookie.
TODD => No.
SARAH => Terri and Lorna.  Sisters, maybe?  Lovers, more like it.  Or...witches. And this bracelet is some sort of talisman.
TODD => You have a perverse mind.
SARAH => Or...perhaps Terri killed Lorna, and this "gift" provides her with an alibi.
TODD => Maybe you should put it back.
SARAH => What, aren't you a little curious?
TODD => Sarah...I don't know how to put this.  This is our fourth night out, and I feel a lot of pressure...for this to work.
SARAH => I want it to work, too.
TODD => Don't you think we're being a little...methodical about the whole thing?  Maybe we should just...
SARAH => What?  Get it over with?
TODD => Not exactly.
SARAH => Don't you think it's better to be sure of each other first? To have a little bit of trust?
TODD => You can trust me.
SARAH => I know, I know.
TODD => Of course not.
SARAH => It's not such a strange thing to ask.  Sometimes relationships...overlap. I just need to feel--
TODD => I told you.  I'm not.
SARAH => You haven't asked me if I'm seeing anyone.
TODD => Is that bad?
SARAH => It's silly, I know, but it makes me feel like you couldn't imagine anyone being interested in me.
TODD => What?  You should be flattered I don't ask.  I respect you enough to assume you'd tell me if you're involved with someone.
SARAH => Hmm.  Ask me, anyway.
TODD => Are you serious?
SARAH => Absolutely not.
SARAH => I do want to make love tonight.
TODD => I'm just worried that all this talk is going to kill the spontaneity--
SARAH => I think spontaneity is overrated.
SARAH => Todd, the light.
SARAH => Wait.  Don't say anything.
TODD => Okay.
SARAH => What were you going to say?
TODD => I wasn't going to say anything.
SARAH => Oh.
TODD => You look beautiful--
SARAH => No, don't say that.  Let's get under the covers.
SARAH => Let's go slowly.
SARAH => Oh.  Oww!
TODD => What happened?
SARAH => Dammit...my foot.  I've got one of those...what's the word?
TODD => A bunion
SARAH => Not a bunion.  A spasm.
TODD => Oh, a foot spasm.  Here let me--
SARAH => Oww!  No, stop!  It hurts!  I hate this!
TODD => What can we do?
SARAH => Nothing, it's fine, it's fine.  Lemme just walk it off.
TODD => She has a better-looking body than I imagined...Breasts are definitely bigger than I thought.  You can just never tell with breasts, can you?...I don't know what to make of this foot problem...Maybe she gets a spasm every time she has sex...I've heard of people with problems like that...People who can't have sex without laughing, or burping...Oh, God, what if she's one of them...
SARAH => I am so embarrassed.  Trust me, this doesn't happen all the time.
TODD => The thought never crossed my mind.
TODD => She won't look at me.  Why won't she look at me?..I'll bet she's preoccupied with her foot.  She's praying she won't get another spasm, another foot freak-out...She's being awfully quiet, too...Why is she so quiet?...Maybe she needs to concentrate...Some women need to concentrate...I read that in a magazine at the grocery store...That blonde check-out girl who works there is really cute...I love the way she says, "Paper or plastic?"...
SARAH => Todd!  Shhh...
TODD => What's the matter?
SARAH => These walls, they're paper-thin.  This building is so poorly built.  Everyone can hear you.
TODD => Is that why you're so quiet?
SARAH => Yes, the walls are...What are you saying?
TODD => It's hard for me to tell if you're enjoying this.
SARAH => Of course, I am.  I'm sorry if I'm not vocal enough for you.
TODD => That's not what I...Sarah, I just want to make sure I'm doing something right here.
SARAH => There's no right or wrong way to do this.
TODD => I know.  I just want to make sure I'm...you know, in the ballpark.
SARAH => Todd, I don't expect you to do everything right the first time...Sorry, that didn't come out the way I meant it...
TODD => You didn't like it.
SARAH => No, I didn't say that.  I was just...Let's be still for a while. Alright?
FADE OUT => FADE IN:
SARAH => Everyone expects fireworks the first time you do it.  But that's just a myth.
TODD => A myth.  You're right.
SARAH => Let's not be too hard on ourselves.
TODD => I agree.
SARAH => Our expectations were a little high, that's all.
TODD => And at the end of the day, sex is only one part of the picture.
SARAH => True.  What do you mean?
TODD => I know this couple. They had nothing in common but good sex. They went at it like a pair of rabbits.  And guess how long it lasted?  A month.  They were hot for each other...but there was nothing else.
SARAH => Right.
FADE OUT => FADE IN:
FADE OUT => FADE IN:
SARAH => Morning, Pappy.  How's she doing today?
GRANDFATHER => Don't pay her any mind, Sarah.  The things she says, they get stranger by the day.
GRANDMOTHER => They keep telling me I'm doing fine, that I'm even improving. Why do they have to lie?  At my age?  What are they trying to protect me from?
SARAH => Maybe they know something you don't.
GRANDMOTHER => Like hell.
SARAH => Nan.
GRANDMOTHER => What?  One in the morning with coffee.  One at night with cocktails. Where was I?
SARAH => Oh, please.
GRANDMOTHER => Your story, that's the one I want to hear.
SARAH => I wish I had a story to tell.
GRANDMOTHER => Hmm.  The last time there was talk of an admirer.
SARAH => All you want is dirt, Nan.  Admit it.
GRANDMOTHER => The world is made of dirt, Sarah.  So, please, dish.  No detail is too small.
SARAH => I...I'm sleeping with two different men.
GRANDMOTHER => Hmm.  Continue.
SARAH => One of them is a good man.  He's good for me.
GRANDMOTHER => Like vitamins.
SARAH => Sort of.  The other one, he can be a complete ass.  A total jerk.
GRANDMOTHER => In other words...he excites you.
SARAH => He does.  And I hate it.  I hate him.  And, on top of that, I can't have him.
GRANDMOTHER => Can you see your Pappy?
SARAH => He hasn't moved.
GRANDMOTHER => Good.  Keep an eye on him.
SARAH => Why?
GRANDMOTHER => Because I'm going to tell you something he shouldn't hear.  Something no one knows.  Once, I had two lovers.  One was your grandfather. He had prospects, then.  He had a car and we drove everywhere and people would look at us and say, "Now, there goes a couple." He never pushed me.  He told me he respected my virginity. And I liked that.
SARAH => Don't worry.  He's not moving.
GRANDMOTHER => The other man -- he was a boy, really -- he had no prospects. And he had no car.  And he had no respect...for anything.  He certainly had no respect for my virginity.  And I liked that, too.
GRANDMOTHER => But I had to make a choice.  I chose your grandfather.  The day before the wedding, I went to let the other boy down.  Met him by a river where we used to swim.  Well, one thing led to another, and when I returned home that night, I'd left my virginity back in the tall grass by that river.
GRANDMOTHER => But I did bring something back.  A bite mark.  That sonuvabitch left on my neck, the size of a peach pit.
SARAH => Did Pappy see it?
GRANDMOTHER => He did and he didn't.  On the wedding night -- in this house -- I managed to squeak by.  It was dark.  We were shy.  He took me in his arms and said, "I'm glad you waited for me."  In other words, I lost my virginity twice in the same week.
SARAH => No small feat.
GRANDMOTHER => It's an accomplishment.  But the next morning, your Pappy saw it.  He demanded an explanation.  And, Sarah, do you know how I got out of that pickle?
SARAH => You lied.
GRANDMOTHER => Damn right.  I said, "What, you don't remember giving me this?" He said, "No."  And I said, "Well, you were so fired up last night, it's a wonder you can remember anything."
SARAH => And you've never been tempted to...
GRANDMOTHER => What?  Come clean with your Pappy?  Why should I tell him?  He had nothing to do with it.
SARAH => Right.
GRANDMOTHER => It's mine.  Not his.
SARAH => I wonder what became of that boy.
GRANDMOTHER => Never saw him again.  I don't regret a thing, if that's what you're wondering.
SARAH => I was, in fact.
GRANDMOTHER => Look what I have.  I have you.
SARAH => I don't believe it.  You're actually asking my opinion.  You really want to know what I think?
JOSH => To tell you the truth, no.  I just wanted to hear your voice. You've barely said "boo" to me all morning.
SARAH => 
JOSH => Alright, what do you think of it?
SARAH => You'd have to pay me to live in that neighborhood.
JOSH => What are they going to think?  That's all that matters.
SARAH => To paraphrase you, this is going to give them a major hard-on. Not the women, of course.
JOSH => You haven't met these women.
JOSH => The champagne order?
SARAH => Done.  Dom Perignon.  Fifteen cases.
JOSH => Invitations?
SARAH => A messenger is meeting us at the site with the proofs.
JOSH => Good.
SARAH => Stop it.
JOSH => I can't.
SARAH => Have you never heard of the phrase "impulse control"?
JOSH => I love it when you're full of contempt.
SARAH => People are starting to notice, Josh.  I work very hard to act completely indifferent toward you.  The least you could do is to keep your hands to yourself.
JOSH => I've got a better idea.
SARAH => What?
JOSH => Why don't I distribute a memo, informing everyone that you and I are not sleeping together?
SARAH => Josh, just for the sake of variety, could you take me seriously for a moment?
JOSH => Alright, alright.  I have another idea.
SARAH => Please, don't...
JOSH => Let's just end it.
SARAH => Yes.  I think we should.
JOSH => Coming?
SARAH => I'm going to take the stairs.
SARAH => I can't put my finger on it...I just don't feel it's happening with us.
TODD => You don't want it work out, that's what you're saying.
SARAH => I do.  I mean, I did.  It's no one's fault.  It's chemistry.
TODD => You want your pickle?
SARAH => Do you want your pickle?!
TODD => You know what the problem is?  The first night we went out, we should've just fucked.  Right away.  Without thinking.  Two dumb bunnies.  Without any history,  any baggage.  A pair of blank slates.  Fucking.  It could've been perfectly meaningless.  You want chemistry?  The less you think, the better the chemistry. Less talk, more action.
SARAH => I'm sorry.  It's just not happening for me.
TODD => The least you can do is give me your goddam pickle.
SARAH => 
SARAH => Guess I'll be heading back...
JOSH => Wait.
SARAH => 
JOSH => You're angry I called it quits, aren't you?  You can admit it.
SARAH => No.  In fact, I want to thank you.
JOSH => For what?
SARAH => For sparing me from the most unhealthy relationship I've ever had in my life.  For that, I thank you.
JOSH => Touch.
SARAH => Are you having seconds thoughts?
JOSH => No.  I say, let's make a clean break.  Let's just walk away from it.
JOSH => What are you doing?
SARAH => Let's seal the deal.  Shake.
JOSH => Alright.  Now that we've put that behind us, there's one problem left.
SARAH => What?
JOSH => Where do we put the bed?
SARAH => Oh, the bed.  Let's put it against this wall.  Away from the morning sun.
JOSH => Wrong.  It's got to go here.  So you can see the hallway.
SARAH => Not enough height for bunk beds.
JOSH => Why do you assume there will be two children?
SARAH => There has to be.  They need to keep each other company.
SARAH => Definitely not enough space for two people to cook.
JOSH => I prefer to eat out.
SARAH => Oh, no.  I wouldn't put the ottoman there.
JOSH => Where would you put it?
SARAH => It needs to go over...
SARAH => Hmmm.
JOSH => What?
SARAH => We have another problem.
JOSH => And that would be...?
SARAH => What do we do with the elephant in the room?
JOSH => You're very clever.
SARAH => We shouldn't be rude to an elephant.
SARAH => They can get very annoyed...if you ignore them.
SARAH => Josh.  The door.
JOSH => I have to tell you, that was the best "break-up" sex I've ever had.
SARAH => It was, wasn't it?
TODD => 
TODD => Dammit.
SARAH => Still dressed in the clothes she wore earlier.  She holds a small paper bag.
TODD => Sarah...
SARAH => I brought you something.
TODD => Pickles.  Huh.
SARAH => Oh.  Sawdust.  Lots of sawdust at the job site.
GIRL => Need some help?
JOSH => Yes, I have a problem.  I need some...something to cover up a...Hell, just take a look.
GIRL => Yeah.  You're fucked.
JOSH => I can do without the attitude, thank-you.
GIRL => Try concealer.  Aisle three.
JOSH => 
GIRL => Just put it on.  And call your lawyer.
GWEN => Unbelievable.
JOSH => What?
GWEN => I'm reading a stupid article in a stupid magazine.
JOSH => If it's stupid, why read it?
GWEN => 
JOSH => Yeah.  She's a bore.
GWEN => She's breaking up with her husband of twenty years.  Said a friend, "Her show's in syndication, she's thin, she's rich and she wants to play." Josh dries his hands.
JOSH => Some poor tree gave its life so we could know that.
GWEN => It's comforting, reading about these broken marriages.
JOSH => Why?
GWEN => It's not enough for our marriage to succeed.  Everyone else's must fail.
JOSH => Is this going to be one of those nights?
GWEN => What?
JOSH => One of those nights we talk.
GWEN => No.  There's no need to talk, because there's no problem.
JOSH => I've been under a lot of stress.
GWEN => You don't have to apologize.  There's nothing wrong with the slump we're going through.  In fact, it's a good thing.
JOSH => How's that?
GWEN => Too much passion can ruin a marriage.  Look at Eric and Sylvia. At the beginning, you couldn't pry them apart.  They were joined at the genitals.  And, then...total burn-out.  A marriage cannot sustain that kind of intensity.  It's good for people to grow bored with each other.  That way, they can meet and fall in love again.
GWEN => In case you hadn't noticed...I'm trying to seduce you.
JOSH => I can feel that.
GWEN => You're welcome to reciprocate.
JOSH => I can't.
GWEN => It's alright.
JOSH => To seduce...to be seduced, there needs to be an element of surprise. I know all your moves.  You know mine.  How can there be any surprise?
GWEN => Rub my feet.
GWEN => I think we should have an affair.
JOSH => What?
GWEN => With each other.
JOSH => That makes no sense.
GWEN => You pick me up at a bar...
JOSH => And, what?  Pretend I don't know you?
GWEN => 
JOSH => THE GRADUATE is about a married woman having an affair with a college boy.
GWEN => When I met you, you were a college boy.
JOSH => Gwen, THE GRADUATE is a story about a very unhappy woman who has an affair out of wedlock.  As I recall, it turns out rather badly for her.
GWEN => Alright.  Bad example.
JOSH => Actors pretend.  That's what they do.  I'm not an actor.  And I love you the way you are.
GWEN => I love you, too.
JOSH => Pretending to be strangers is not going to solve the problem.
GWEN => Who said there was a problem?
JOSH'S POV => Through the crowd he spots Sarah, entering with her date -- Todd.
GWEN => Your lovely assistant is here.
JOSH => I don't ask her about her personal life.
SARAH => Hey, you two.  Todd, this is my boss Josh, and his wife Gwen.
TODD => Sarah's told me a lot about you.
GWEN => Sarah, you look great.  You've been keeping my boy on his best behavior?
SARAH => It's a dirty job, but somebody's got to do it.
GWEN => I know he asks to go above and beyond the call of duty.
SARAH => He can be tough.
JOSH => But fair.
GWEN => Josh, I'm trying to thank Sarah for all the extra attention she gives you.
SARAH => You're welcome.
GWEN => We should really have you over for dinner, Sarah.  It's been too long.  You can bring...
TODD => Todd.
GWEN => Sorry.  I'm hopeless when it comes to names.
JOSH => Especially after two glasses of champagne.
GWEN => Hey, I'm still working on the first, thank you.
TODD => Living together?  No.
SARAH => We've only known each other a few weeks.
GWEN => You two seem to fit.  It only took me a few days to know with Josh.  In fact, I knew after the first date.
SARAH => You knew what?
GWEN => That he was the one for me.
JOSH => 
SARAH => 
GWEN => Well, it was the cheapest date I've ever been on.
JOSH => I was broke.
GWEN => Do you know the Chinese place on Third?  That little hole-in-the-wall?
TODD => I know it.  Used to be a cool dive.  Now it's ultra-hip and overpriced.
GWEN => Really?  I think our first dinner cost a grand total of ten dollars.
JOSH => Gwen loves to dissect our first date.
GWEN => It was a momentous night.  Babe, we should really go back there.
JOSH => Gwen, why don't you continue your stroll down memory lane while I drink?  Todd, you up for it?
TODD => Sure.
JOSH => 
TODD => I'm fine, thanks.
JOSH => So...Sarah's an attractive girl.
TODD => Very.
JOSH => You two serious?
TODD => 
JOSH => She wants to play the field, right?
TODD => No, that's not it.
JOSH => I see.  You want to fuck around.
JOSH => C'mon, we're guys.  I know the drill.
TODD => We dated a few times, and to be honest, I was on the fence about Sarah.  I liked her, but I didn't think we were in a good groove. Then, a couple weeks ago, her grandmother died.  Things changed.
JOSH => I didn't know.
TODD => It wasn't unexpected, but Sarah took it really hard.  So where did that leave me?  I was ambivalent about things, right?  But then my ambivalence had to take a back seat.  I had to be there for her.  Completely.  And, ready or not, our relationship became...a real relationship.
TODD => You know, I wasn't ready to be that involved with anybody.  I don't know...Death has a funny way of making you get outside yourself.
JOSH'S POV => Gwen is still chatting with Sarah.  Gwen makes eye contact with Josh and sends him a warm smile.
GWEN => You missed the on-ramp.
JOSH => I know.
GWEN => Why?
JOSH => Somewhere we need to go first.
GWEN => We don't have to do this tonight.
JOSH => Yes, we do.
GWEN => We can't go in here.  Everything's different.
JOSH => That's okay.  We're different, too.
GWEN => Sarah's a very interesting girl.  Did you know she's training for the marathon?
JOSH => I don't want to talk about Sarah.
GWEN => What do you want to talk about, then?
JOSH => I want to talk about me...
JOSH => ...and what a fool I've been.
JOSH => I thought if we came here tonight we could...start again.
GWEN => 
JOSH => 
GWEN => You're supposed to wait--
JOSH => I can't wait.  I have to know.
JOSH => 
GWEN => 
JOSH => 
GWEN => Hmm.  That's what I've heard.
JOSH => The last cookie.  Go ahead.
GWEN => No.  You open it.
JOSH => It's blank.
GWEN => Blank...in bed.  That's disappointing.
JOSH => No, it's perfect.  Blank...no problems, no history, nothing...in bed.
JOSH => By the way, I didn't get your name.
GWEN => What?
GWEN => My name is Gail.  Gail Bonds.
JOSH => Well, Gail, I'm not usually this forward on a first date, may I take you to my car and ravish you?
GWEN => Hmm.  On one condition.
JOSH => What's that?
GWEN => That you tell me your name.
JOSH => Oh, I thought everyone knew my name.  I'm Bill Gates.  Billionaire.
GWEN => Is it true what they say, Bill, about billionaires?  That all the wealth is just a way to compensate...for size?
JOSH => People are jealous.
GWEN => I can imagine.  It must be so lonely at the top.
GWEN => What are you doing?
JOSH => What do you think I'm doing?
GWEN => We're not in a bed.
JOSH => You shouldn't read fortune cookies too literally.
JOSH => ...Can anyone see us?...Is anyone looking?...Why should it bother you?  You're alone...with your wife...That's the way it's supposed to be...You know every inch of her...every smell...every sigh...every freckle...the shape of her ass...the mole under her nipple...the whole history of her body...And, you know that if you really concentrate, you can succeed...in imagining...she's someone you don't know...
FADE OUT => FADE IN:
GWEN => Color.  That's the problem with this room, it needs color.  Think of...the vibrant colors of Haiti.
JOANNE => Personally, Haiti does nothing for me.  When your father and I were there -- this was before you were born, I almost died from a piece of lettuce, and I wouldn't want anything to remind me of that trip.
GWEN => Alright.  I didn't say anything.
JOANNE => Because you're not sure?
GWEN => No, I'm sure.  I'm sure he's sleeping with her.
JOANNE => Hmm.
GWEN => What?  You think I should just forget about it?
JOANNE => Yes, I do.
GWEN => Mother, don't you think honesty is essential in a marriage?
JOANNE => It depends.  It can be quite detrimental.
JOANNE => Alright.  Confront him.  You know where it will get you.  Your whole marriage will unravel, and you'll have nothing.  All the things you take for granted -- month-long vacations in St. Lucia -- they'll disappear.  You'll be a divorced woman in her late 30s.  Lonely.
GWEN => Why did I invite you over?  You make me feel like shit.
JOANNE => That's my job.
GWEN => The machine can get it.
JOANNE => I don't monitor calls.  It makes me feel like I'm hiding in my own home.
VOICE => Gwen, this is David Warren.  Hopefully, a welcome voice from your past.  My show's on hiatus and I'm in town for the weekend. I'd love to catch up.  Are you free for coffee...or something?
JOANNE => Pick up the phone.
VOICE => I have no idea what you're up to...I hope life is treating you well.  I heard through a friend of a friend of a friend that you're still married.  Congratulations.  If you want, give me a call.  I'm crashing at my sister's.  The number is -- hold on-- the number is 235-4511.  Hope to hear from you.
CLICK. => GWEN Wow.
JOANNE => How long has it been?
GWEN => College.
JOANNE => Have you ever seen his show?  It's absolutely dreadful.  I never miss it.
GWEN => If Josh isn't home, I'll watch it.
JOANNE => Hmm.  It's Kismet, then.
GWEN => What?
JOANNE => A brief liaison with an old flame.  The perfect way to deal with your anger.
GWEN => You're insane.  You're an insane mother.
JOANNE => It'll be good for your self-esteem.
GWEN => Did it occur to you that maybe he just wants to have coffee?
DAVID => ...on hiatus and I'm in town for the weekend.  Are you free for coffee...or something?
JOANNE => "Coffee...or something."  He's flirting, admit it.  Coffee...or something.
GWEN => He's stammering.  He's nervous.  He's calling out of the blue!
JOANNE => You're wrong.  I'm right, and I'm going.  But take a tip from someone who's been there.  Opportunity is knocking, Gwen.  You have a chance to level the playing field.
JOSH => You're right.  We could use some more color in the living room.
GWEN => Yes?
JOSH => I said you're right.
GWEN => About what?
JOSH => About more color in the living room.
GWEN => Oh.  I'm glad you think so.
DESK CLERK => And how many nights will you be staying with us?
GWEN => One.
DESK CLERK => We do have a two-night minimum.
GWEN => Then...two.
GWEN => I'd like to pay in cash.
DESK CLERK => That won't be a problem.  We just need a credit card imprint for your incidentals...
DESK CLERK => ...which we tear up when you check out.
DESK CLERK => Will you be needing more than one key?
GWEN => Two, please.
DAVID WARREN => I'm still reeling.  It was the most humbling experience of my life.  Getting raked over the coals by a bunch of sixteen-year old drama students!  At my own alma mater!
GWEN => I'm surprised they weren't all over you.
DAVID WARREN => They were, with knives drawn.
GWEN => What did they say?
DAVID WARREN => Basically, why am I working on a piece of shit like MALIBU NIGHTS when I should be doing Shakespeare or Chekhov?
WAITER => Compliments from the table in the corner.
GWEN => See?  Those women are happy you're not doing Shakespeare.
DAVID WARREN => Gwen.  You look great.  You haven't changed a bit.
GWEN => I don't think I'm MALIBU NIGHTS material.
DAVID WARREN => Those women!  Walking boob jobs.  They're appalling.
GWEN => You look like you enjoy kissing them.
DAVID WARREN => It's very simple.  I close my eyes and imagine I'm kissing someone else.
GWEN => Hmm.  Someone else in particular?
DAVID WARREN => Yes.
GWEN => If she's as tan as you, I don't want to hear about it.
DAVID WARREN => Here, take a look...
DAVID WARREN => What's wrong with this picture, huh?
GWEN => Well...Let's start with the man, upper left.
DAVID WARREN => Andy.  My partner.  And the best thing that's ever happened to me.
GWEN => Okay.  And the boy?
DAVID WARREN => Eric.  He's Andy's son from a marriage that -- needless to say -- didn't work.  Andy came out when Eric was just five.  Great kid.
GWEN => And when did you...?
DAVID WARREN => Come out?  About fifteen years ago.
GWEN => No.  But fifteen years ago...That was right after--
DAVID WARREN => You and me.
GWEN => Was I the last woman?
GWEN => Was I that bad?
DAVID WARREN => No, you were fantastic.  I was completely confused.
DAVID WARREN => What's the matter?
GWEN => Nothing.  I'm very happy for you.  And, I have to confess, I'm relieved.
DAVID WARREN => Why?
GWEN => Oh -- what the hell -- we're friends, right?
DAVID WARREN => I'm listening.
GWEN => I had this ridiculous idea that you wanted to get together to have a...
DAVID WARREN => Oh.
GWEN => You know...for old time's sake.
DAVID WARREN => Uh-huh.
GWEN => And, frankly, I wasn't looking forward to turning you down. Which I would have, of course.  Had you...asked.  Which you're not, because you're...you're...
DAVID WARREN => Married.
GWEN => Right.
DAVID WARREN => Happily.
GWEN => Right.
GWEN => Would you pour me a little more, David?
DESK CLERK => Can I help you, ma'am?
DESK CLERK => Are you okay?
GWEN => I'd like to check out.
DESK CLERK => Was there a problem?
GWEN => Yes.  I was stood up...by the past.
DESK CLERK => I'm sorry.  We won't charge you for the room.
GWEN => No, you don't understand.
DESK CLERK => Yes.  I do.
DESK CLERK => Shall I close out the account?
GWEN => No.  I need the room after all.
DESK CLERK => You're in luck.  I was just about to take my break.
DESK CLERK => Something from the mini-bar?
GWEN => No.
DESK CLERK => How's the air conditioning?
GWEN => Fine.
DESK CLERK => Shall I pull down the covers?
GWEN => I suppose.
DESK CLERK => Do you want to know my name?
GWEN => No.
DESK CLERK => You're shaking.
GWEN => I'll be fine.
DESK CLERK => I don't care.
GWEN => You don't even know me.
DESK CLERK => You're right.
GWEN => We have nothing in common.
DESK CLERK => That's where you're wrong.
DESK CLERK => 
GWEN => Thank you for taking care of the room.
DESK CLERK => Your welcome.
GWEN => ...And now the score is tied...Oh my God, what will I tell my mother?  I did it with a desk clerk.  Hardly the affair to remember...Of course, she will disapprove.  "Is English even his first language? This is your idea of a liaison?  Your idea of leveling the playing field?  You don't even know the boy's name--"
GWEN => What's your name?
DESK CLERK => David.
GWEN => What?  You're kidding me.
DAVID => No.  What's so funny?
GWEN => Nothing, it's just--
GWEN => Sorry, I just...I didn't think you'd be named David.
DAVID => Why are you here?
ROSALIE => You weren't going to return my calls.
DAVID => Don't you have more important things to do?  Picking flowers, honeymoon reservations...
ROSALIE => Is there somewhere we can talk?
DAVID => 
ROSALIE => Is there somewhere we can talk?
DAVID => What's wrong with here?
ROSALIE => Privately.
DAVID => But here, I won't be tempted to raise my voice or do something rash.  That's the first lesson of hotel management.  Never lose your cool, no matter how annoying the guest is.  Not that I plan to go into hotel management.  I don't have ambitions in that direction.  Or any direction, if I recall you correctly.
DAVID => 
DAVID => Rosie, you'd better leave.  Before I get myself fired.
HOTEL MANAGER => Yo, fiddler on the roof.
HOTEL MANAGER => 
DAVID => Discipline.  Always a struggle.
HOTEL MANAGER => I hear you.  For instance, it takes a certain discipline to know that when you're working at the hotel, when you're on the clock...
DAVID => It won't happen again.
HOTEL MANAGER => Good.
ROSALIE. => She's been waiting.
DAVID => Jesus!
ROSALIE => I want you to be there on Sunday.
DAVID => No.
ROSALIE => You told me we'd always be friends.
DAVID => I lied.
ROSALIE => You're an important part of my life, David.  There's so much history between us.  I don't want to trash it simply because--
DAVID => Because what?  Because you're getting married?
DAVID => Rosie, I want you to be happy.  I do.  And someday, we'll be friends.  Someday, we'll all go out to dinner.  The four of us.
ROSALIE => The four of us?
DAVID => Sure.  Me, you, Jerry, and whatever pale imitation of you I can dig up to be my date.
ROSALIE => Stop it.
DAVID => And the check will come and Jerry will pick up the tab and I'll protest, but not too much.  Then, you'll give me a kiss on the cheek, and some dim memory will stir in me, but not for too long. And we'll say, "It was great to see you."  And it will be great to see you...
WEDDING PLANNER => We've  got a few more things to cover.  The photos.  There's a courtyard behind the church.  It's a popular backdrop.  Our photographer says the light is gorgeous.  We need twenty minutes before the ceremony for singles.
JERRY => I know.  It is an election year.
WEDDING PLANNER => Exactly what he said.
ROSALIE => It's okay.
WEDDING PLANNER => Right.  The guest list.  We have a few more no-show's.
WEDDING PLANNER => Mr. and Mrs. Bennett send their regrets.  Also, Ms. Rothman will no be attending.
ROSALIE => Oh.  David Freeman.  He's not coming.
JERRY => He's not?
ROSALIE => No.  He's not.
JERRY => After all that shit you put me through, now he's not even coming.
WEDDING PLANNER => So, if there are any last-minute--
JERRY => 
ROSALIE => Yes, I talked to him.  And I...
WEDDING PLANNER => Take your time.
ROSALIE => I talked to David.  And...I uninvited him.
JERRY => What?
ROSALIE => I told him it wasn't right.  I told him he shouldn't be at our wedding.
JERRY => When did you decide this?
ROSALIE => I don't know...I just realized I don't want our wedding to be about where I've been.  I want it to be about where you and I are going.
JERRY => What did he say?
ROSALIE => Jerry...
JERRY => I want to know.
ROSALIE => He was disappointed--
JERRY => Of course he was.  He's still in love with you.
ROSALIE => But he understands.  I drew the line, honey.
JERRY => Thank-you.
ROSALIE => I did it for us.
DAVID => 
ROSALIE => Were you sleeping?
DAVID => Yes.  I was.
ROSALIE => Liar.  You're practicing.  I can hear you.
DAVID'S POV => Rosalie -- on her cell -- waves to him from the sidewalk, three stories below.
ROSALIE => It's so sad.  Why do you always play sad songs?
DAVID => I don't write 'em, Rose.
ROSALIE => Please let me in.
DAVID => No.
ROSALIE => You don't trust me?
DAVID => No.
ROSALIE => I'm going to wait here for one minute.  Sixty seconds.
DAVID => You do that.
ROSALIE => Then, I'm gone.  You won't see me again.
DAVID'S POV => Rosalie sits on the front steps.  Stubborn.
DAVID => 
DAVID => If I go down those stairs...it will only lead to one place...right back here...the two of us...a short, brilliant moment...one more to add to the gallery...then, empty-handed again, with nothing to show for it but an emotional hangover...I'm not going to open this door... Discipline... Like the man said, don't fuck the guests...
DAVID => I've got nothing to say to you.
ROSALIE => Fine.  I'll talk...
ROSALIE => The reason I won't just leave you alone is not because I'm "confused." My feelings are perfectly clear.  I know you find it incomprehensible that I can love Jerry and love you.  And that one love has nothing to do with the other.  But it's true.
DAVID => Rose...
ROSALIE => What?
DAVID => This is bullshit.  I can't spell it out any more plainly.  It's impossible!
ROSALIE => Why?
DAVID => Because I can't be this close to you...and not want to touch you.
ROSALIE => That's it?
DAVID => That's...it.
DAVID => And if I can't do that, I don't want to be your friend.  Not now.  Not ever.
ROSALIE => Don't be so mean.
DAVID => The bottom line is...If I'm with you, I have to touch you, to kiss you.  That doesn't work for friends, does it?
DAVID => When I'm not with you -- this is more than you need to know...If I touch myself, I can only think about one person. You.  No one else.  Just you.
ROSALIE => What do we do?
DAVID => What do you mean "we"?  This is your problem.
ROSALIE => Stop...
DAVID => You have to say good-bye.
ROSALIE => I don't know how...
DAVID => Should we stop?
ROSALIE => David, will you hand me my shampoo?  It's in my purse.
ROSALIE => Hail Mary, full of Grace, blessed be the  fruit of thy womb Jesus...Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners, now and at the hour of our death, Amen...Hail Mary, full of Grace, blessed be the fruit of...
ON ROSALIE => She nudges him.  He doesn't stir.  Rosalie sits at the foot of the bed.  She grabs the remote and "un-mutes" the sound.
EXPERT => ...And the change is not just physical.  You'll be amazed how quickly your whole outlook will--
JERRY => Hey...
ROSALIE => Hey...
JERRY => What time is it?
ROSALIE => Late.
JERRY => It is late.  What happened?
ROSALIE => Oh.  The girls.  Wedding talk.  We could've gone on all night.
ROSALIE => Jerry...
JERRY => What?
ROSALIE => We need to make love now.
JERRY => Okay...why now?
ROSALIE => I can't explain it.  We just need to make love now.
JERRY => What's the matter?
ROSALIE => I just need to fix this moment in my mind.
ROSALIE => I love you.  Totally.  Completely.  I don't want to spend another minute of my life without you.
JERRY => You're forgetting something.
ROSALIE => No, I'm not.
JERRY => Don't you think...
ROSALIE => No, I don't.  Let's not use it tonight.
JERRY => If you're ready, so am I.
ROSALIE => Jerry?
JERRY => What?
ROSALIE => Talk to me...
FADE OUT => FADE IN: OMITTED
FLASH! => rOSALIE
FLASH...FLASH! => rOSALIE
PRIEST => A lot of young couples prefer "husband and wife" to the traditional "man and wife."  Personally, I don't feel the phrase "man and wife" gives the woman a diminutive status.  But I leave the choice in your hands.  Do you have a--
ROSALIE => Husband and wife.  Definitely.
PRIEST => Good.
ROSALIE => That could be tough.  For him.
PRIEST => Remember, this is God's house.  And there will be prominent people here as well.  Not to mention the press.  So, let's keep things on the up-and-up.
FATHER => Here we are.  Bahia Gold.  Two hundred a box.
JERRY => You don't have to do this, Dad.
FATHER => If I can't come to the bachelor party, I want to be there in spirit.
JERRY => Thank-you.
FATHER => I remember my bachelor night.  Frankly, I wish I didn't.  Not a night I'm particularly proud of...I'll leave it at that.
JERRY => Why are you sharing this?
FATHER => Reminiscing.  That's all.
JERRY => Or warning me.
FATHER => Nonsense.  I know you.  You won't make an ass out of yourself.
JERRY => What's this?
FATHER => It's a key.
JERRY => I can't accept this.
FATHER => Yes, you can.
FATHER => Uh-huh.  I get it.  This is Rosalie's domain.  She should have a say in where you two settle down.  But don't worry, you won't be forcing her hand.  Know why?  Because she's going to love it.
FATHER => Let's ring these babies up.
BEST FRIEND => Alright, my man.  You ready?
JERRY => Do I have a choice?
BEST FRIEND => No.
JERRY => Then, I'm ready.
BEST FRIEND => The guys pitched in for this...
BEST FRIEND => So go up there and get our money's worth.
JERRY => Why am I stopping?...There's a hot girl waiting on the other side of the door...Why worry?  Everyone cuts you slack for this kind of thing...This is supposed to happen...It's a tradition, a time-honored ritual...Losing your tooth, losing your virginity, losing the championship...If I walk through this door, what am I losing?  Nothing...My father was here, and his father was here, and his father's father was here, hand on the door...What am I waiting for...
LORNA => Sitting on the bed in a tank-top and a short skirt.  As fetching as ever.
LORNA => You must be the groom.
LORNA => The guys were right.  You're a looker.
JERRY => Did they also tell you I don't usually do this kind of thing.
LORNA => All the better.  I like challenges.
LORNA => Getting married tomorrow, huh?
JERRY => Yes, I am.
LORNA => Love, honor, and obey.  That's the drill, isn't it?
JERRY => Yes.  Tomorrow, I take the vows.
LORNA => Tomorrow...So, technically, this doesn't count.
JERRY => How's that?
LORNA => You can't break a vow you haven't taken, can you?
JERRY => You sound like my lawyer.
LORNA => I've done my share of lawyers.  They spend most of the hour negotiating the tip.
JERRY => I got it.
LORNA => Something bothering you?
JERRY => I don't know if I should be doing this.
LORNA => Want my philosophy?  If we don't make mistakes now and then, how are we ever going to learn from them?
JERRY => Now you sound like my priest.
LORNA => I've done a few of them, too.
JERRY => Priests?
LORNA => Lousy tippers.  They spend most of the hour feeling bad about what they're doing.  But they do it anyway.  Then, they shortchange you on the tip.  One of them absolved me once, before he left. That's something, I guess.
JERRY => Who are the best tippers?
LORNA => The guys who can least afford it.  Guys with families.
JERRY => And the worst?
LORNA => Hands-down.  Politicians.
JERRY => Politicians?
LORNA => Sure.  Both parties.  I don't discriminate.  Besides, a penis doesn't know from politics.  A penis is the most politically incorrect part of the body.  It has a simple agenda.
JERRY => Stop it.  I can't do it.
LORNA => Don't worry about it.
JERRY => I can't...I'm sorry.
LORNA => Hey, it's no sweat.  I get paid either way.
JERRY => No, you don't understand.  I can't fucking go through with it!
JERRY => Jesus!
ON LORNA => She shakes her head --  she's completely nonplussed.
LORNA => That was smart.   Now, you're bleeding.  Here...
LORNA => Better?
JERRY => Yeah...
LORNA => Do you love her?
JERRY => I don't know.
LORNA => C'mon.  Let's sit down.
JERRY => She wants to have a baby.  That's the way it's supposed to be, right?
LORNA => I wouldn't know.
JERRY => My parents approve of her.  Her parents approve of me.  Everybody approves...
LORNA => What's wrong with a little approval?
JERRY => That's my whole life.  My whole goddam carrot-and-stick-life. Ever since I can remember, I've been chasing after this person or that person's approval.  Playing one role, then another. Then another!  The good student.  The good son.  The industrious boy.  Good grades.  High ambitions.  Pats on the back.  Handshakes from people who matter!  The good boyfriend, getting on his knees and proposing to the good girlfriend.  The dutiful bachelor, receiving the traditional blow-job from a...
LORNA => 
JERRY => I've lost count of all the roles, there's so many of them.
LORNA => Huh.
LORNA => I don't see what the big deal is.  I play roles all the time.
JERRY => And you want to do that your entire life?  You can't...you...
LORNA => Lorna.  And I'll do whatever the hell I want.
JERRY => Well, I can't live somebody else's version of my life anymore. Do you understand?
LORNA => Sure.  I do.
LORNA => Here's your chance.
JERRY => What?
LORNA => It's not too far a drop to the lawn.  You have gas in your car? Then, go.  It's the first day of the rest of your life...Go. I promise you, this opportunity will not come around twice.
HIS POV => The suburbs at night.  Cozy, warm-lit.
JERRY => I'm going to do it.
LORNA'S POV => She watches him hit the ground, hobble across the lawn, and get into his car.  And he's gone.
LORNA => See?  Easy.
CUT TO => OMITTED
LORNA'S POV => Behind the counter lies a crumpled newspaper.
LORNA => 
WAITRESS => It's yesterday's.  Morning paper should be here any minute.
LORNA => I just want the crossword puzzle.
LORNA => Oh my...
WAITRESS => There's a catch, alright.
TERRI => Hello...It's the oldest condition known to man.  Cold feet.
LORNA => You're wrong.  I'm telling you he's two states away by now.
TERRI => If you're wrong, you're paying for drinks tonight.
TERRI => Well, what do you know...
TERRI => Told you we should've dressed up.
LORNA => C'mon...we're going inside.
TERRI => What for?  Wait...
TERRI => Lorna, we shouldn't be here.
LORNA => Excuse me, could you tell me who's getting married in...
TODD => I'm sorry. Have we met?
LORNA => Yeah.  You don't remember me?
TODD => You must be thinking of somebody else.
LORNA => Right.  I must be thinking of someone else.  Sorry.
TODD => Excuse me...
TERRI => What was that all about?
LORNA => Nothing.
TERRI => Nothing, my ass.
LORNA => Alright, alright.  I slipped.
TERRI => Slipped?  You broke the cardinal rule of the trade.
LORNA => What is this?  Hooking For Dummies?  C'mon...
LORNA'S POV => The front pews are packed, all eyes focussed on the wedding party at the altar.  Jerry and Rosalie face the priest, who blesses the ring.
PRIEST => The wedding ring is a powerful symbol.  It is a circle, with no beginning and no end.  It is also the circle that encloses your love for each other--
TERRI => I'll bet that dress is Vera Wang.
LORNA => Shhh...
PRIEST => Do you, Rosalie, take this man, to have and to hold, in sickness and in health, till death do you part?
ROSALIE => I do.
PRIEST => And do you, Jerry, take this woman, to have and to hold, in sickness and in health, till death do you part?
JERRY => I do.
PRIEST => Then, by the power invested in me by Christ, Our Lord, I now pronounce you husband and wife.
TERRI => You're crying, I can't believe it.
LORNA => No, I'm not.
SECURITY GUARD => Ladies, this event is strictly for invited guests.
TERRI => We're with the groom's party.
SECURITY GUARD => Ma'am...Let's not do this.  You're not with the groom.
TERRI => She had his cock in her mouth last night.  Doesn't that count?
LORNA => I don't know why he came back.
TERRI => Guess you'll never know for sure.
TERRI => Remember the guy I told you about -- the writer?
LORNA => Yeah.  He said he wanted to immortalize you.  What a line.
TERRI => He's been steady work.  Every Tuesday for the past month.  Well, get this.  Yesterday, he called and asked me out.
LORNA => On a date?
TERRI => Yeah.  A date.
LORNA => A non-paying date.
TERRI => No money will be exchanged.  You want to hear the weird part? I said yes.
LORNA => You're right.  That is weird.
TERRI => You gotta keep an open mind, Lorna.
TERRI => C'mon, what are you waiting for?
ON LORNA => She lingers at the curb for a moment, pondering her next move.
