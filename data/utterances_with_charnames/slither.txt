STARLA => When Darwin said 'fittest,' he didn't necessarily mean the strongest or the most intelligent, or any one trait -- he merely meant those organisms most well-suited to their environment.
STARLA => We humans think we're more fit, more evolved, because we're smarter. But we're neophytes. We've been around two million years, give or take. The cockroach has been here for 350 million. You tell me who's the more successful species.
STARLA => Will.
WILL => How's all this go with how the Bible says there ain't no dinosaurs?
STARLA => We'll tackle that tomorrow... Everyone bring your boxing gloves.
JACK => Get the fuck out of the way, cocksucker!
MOTHER => Mornin', Mayor.
KYLIE => Prolly go find it later, sell it on eBay.
GRANT => Just a tremor, boys.
TREVOR => Did ya' feel that?!
TREVOR => I always get afraid when that happens, 'cause what if the ground cracks open and you fall inside? It's so hot in there you get all burnt to nothin' like that --  Happened to my uncle Barry.
WALLY => Who told you that story, Trevor?
TREVOR => My aunt.
BILL => Your uncle Barry left her for a stripper up in Winnsboro.
SHELBY => Chief! We got a 'mergency over at the diner!
WAITRESS => Back there, Bill!
WAITRESS => She slipped in, was eating trash. We seen it on TV, how they kill ya'--
BILL => Right.
WAITRESS => So we thought we best call in.
BILL => Come on now, honey, door's this way.
MARGARET => It's open season. Let's shoot her.
BILL => She's just scared, Margaret.
WALLY => Also, Bill likes to take a female through the back door any chance he gets.
BILL => She ain't a bull, Trevor!
MARGARET => Goddamn bambi-rat!
BILL => Get back.
BILL => It's okay, sweetheart.   Nobody's gonna hurt you.
BILL => That's right. Just gonna pull this cord out. It's gonna be all right.
BILL => Hell, she took a phone. Now them forest critters are gonna be calling us all hours of the night.
WALLY => Chief of police there? This a squirrel. Bring me a bag of peanuts, motherfucker!
SECRETARY => 'Night, Mr. Grant.
GRANT => See ya', Ashley.
GRANT => So I get home today, phone's ringing. It's Hank Wilcox.
GRANT => Callin' for you. What the hell? I said, 'Hank, that's a little bit outta line don't'cha think, a single man callin' someone's wife?' At night, nonetheless.
STARLA => He's teaching environmental science, Grant. Probably wants to borrow my lesson plans from last semester.
GRANT => Oh yeah, that's what he wants to borrow, this guy.
STARLA => It's just a work thing.
GRANT => Work thing hell, Starla. He just wants to get in your pussy. Him and most these other ones around here. That's where their minds is at, them sick fucks.
GRANT => I'll tell you, sugarplum, you're lucky you got me. You're too damn trusting. Without me to protect you, you'd get kilt one of these days.
GRANT => Sugarplum, you coming into bed?
STARLA => Just a second.
STARLA => Grant, no -- I'm sorry, I'm just -- I'm not in the mood.
GRANT => Come on, baby, it's --
STARLA => I'm sorry.   I don't just have some switch.
GRANT => Sure you do.
GRANT => Flip.
GRANT => Flip.
STARLA => That's disrespectful.
GRANT => When are you in the mood, exactly? Seems to me that mood's as rare as winnin' the Goddamn lotto.
STARLA => Where are you going?
GRANT => I'm just some big clown to you, ain't I?
STARLA => That's not true -- Where are you-?
GRANT => Out.
GRANT => Hit me again there, killer.
BARKEEP => Hey, Grant, how's it you come to have the same last name as first?
GRANT => Parents thought it sounded pleasant, I s'pose. Joke on me, ain't it?
BRENDA => Megan Halesy' little sister.
GRANT => Shit.   You're kidding me.
BRENDA => Nope.   Brenda!
GRANT => Hell, you were --
BRENDA => I was! And I'll tell you somethin', Grant Grant. I's in love with you.
BRENDA => My sister Megan, she's a big fat cow. Was then, even more so now. I'd be thinking, what'd you see in her ain't in me?
GRANT => Shit, girl, you couldn't'a been eleven.
BRENDA => Hell, I was game!
GRANT => Who's the lucky fella?
BRENDA => Fuck lucky. Never marry a damn half-Mexican.
GRANT => Already ain't.     Married a gal named --
BRENDA => Starla Covington. Don't be ignorant. Everyone knows that. Fucking prom queen.
GRANT => Yeah.
BRENDA => Where you goin'?
GRANT => Starla, she gets real worried 'bout me I stay out too late. Loves me too much, that one.
GRANT => What the...?
GRANT => Hey, anybody 'round here?   'Lo?
GRANT => Ow!   Fuck!
CAMPER => Over here!
CAMPER => Hey, man. You all right?... Dude?... Oh shit.
CAMPER => I think he's d --
GRANT => It's taking... my... brain.
CAMPER => Buddy?
CAMPER => You all right, man?
CAMPER => That might of been a stroke, buddy. You better take it easy.
NEIGHBOR => Hey ya', Grant.
NEIGHBOR => What were ya', night-fishing again? You catch anything?
GRANT => I caught a little somethin', yeah.
GRANT => Hey there, sugarplum.
STARLA => Haven't heard this for a while.
STARLA => I never danced in a towel before.
GRANT => Wearing white, just like on our... wedding day. I remember it.
GRANT => I'm sorry about last night. I get a little insecure sometimes, want to hold on too tight. It's just 'cause you're precious to me, Starla. 
GRANT => But I swear to God, baby, I'm turning over a new Goddamn leaf. Okay?
GRANT => I love you, sugarplum.
STARLA => Grant, what's that?
GRANT => Just a little bug bite is all.
JANENE => What are you so smiley about, girl?
STARLA => Oh, nothin'.
STARLA => Just, Grant and I had a nice morning. It's been a while.
JANENE => Oh! You got that fresh-fucked glow, don't you?
STARLA => Janene.
JANENE => You slut.
STARLA => Hush.
JANENE => No shame.   You're a married woman.
STARLA => He was... considerate. Maybe this is the start of a real change in Grant.
GRANT => Meat.
GRANT => Meat.
BUTCHER => Howdy, Mr. Grant. You goin' to the Deer Cheer this weekend?
GRANT => Sure thing, killer.
BUTCHER => What can I do you for?
GRANT => Thinkin' 'bout getting me a couple of these big ol' rib eyes.
BUTCHER => How many you need?
GRANT => Well... having us a little dinner party... I'd say... eight. No, no... fourteen...
GRANT => Hell, what am I holding back for? Why don't you just give me everything you got here?
BUTCHER => All the rib eyes?
GRANT => Yep. And while you're at it, get me a few of them chicken wings... some pork loins... and, ooo, what's this here? Osso buco?...
GRANT => Meat.
GRANT => You're meat.
GRANT => Welcome home.
STARLA => Grant? Why are there -- did you put locks on the garage?
STARLA => You drilled into the driveway.
GRANT => Yeahhhh. I'm sorry. I just got so excited about... your present.
STARLA => My present?
GRANT => You're my princess, aren't you?
STARLA => Okay.
GRANT => I got a super-special birthday present for you this year. I couldn't risk you finding it, so I had to put them locks on the doors.
STARLA => All right... I have to clean up before dinner.
GRANT => You're meat.
STARLA => What?
GRANT => Oh, nothin'.   Nothin'.   See you in a sec.
GRANT => Meat.
STARLA => Roscoe's gone?
BOY => You haven't seen him, have you?
STARLA => I'm sure he'll show up, Tim.
STARLA => Grant, are you almost ready?
GRANT => Yeah, hon, I'll be right there!
STARLA => What are you doing?
GRANT => You're pretty.
GRANT => Who's that?
STARLA => It's just one of my students, Grant.
TREVOR => What's she see in that douchebag?
BILL => That's the mystery of the ages there, Trev. Starla was seventeen when they got engaged. He was, like, in his thirties. No one even knew they were goin' out till she had that ring on her finger.
MARGARET => Ain't no mystery to it. She's raised in them shanties off St. Luc. Dirt-poor.
TREVOR => Gold-digger, huh?
BILL => Hell, you don't know that, Margaret.
JACK => Bill, you're Chief of police now. 
JACK => Comes with some Goddamn responsibility, like keeping your people in line.
BILL => You're right, Jack.    Margaret, you're fired.
STARLA => Janene!
JANENE => Hey, Grant.
GRANT => Why don't you two catch up? I'll go see what the boys are doing.
STARLA => He's been strange the past couple days.
BRENDA => Hey there, handsome.
BRENDA => Must be fate, us meeting again like this.
GRANT => Well, you might be right...
GRANT => You're lookin' awful pretty.
BRENDA => Shut up.
GRANT => Where's the old half-Mexican?
BRENDA => Took the kids to his Mom's for the weekend.
BRENDA => Where you takin' me, you bad boy!
GRANT => Take off your shirt, doll.
GRANT => Guess it's hard to explain how amazin' a human brain is to someone who that's all they know.
BRENDA => What?
GRANT => Stuff you can never imagine. Feelings. Big thoughts. And love. Yeah. I'm inclined to parlay it into somethin' more. So, go ahead there, beautiful, and take off your shirt.
GRANT => Nice.
BRENDA => Grant!?    What -- ?!
BRENDA => No, no, we --
STARLA => Hey, Bill!
BILL => Don't worry. The lurker ain't around. I checked.
STARLA => That's not funny.
BILL => Sorry.
STARLA => Whatcha' doin'?
BILL => Tryin' to get a buzz on. But I'm too buff. Too much muscle mass.
BILL => What you up to?
STARLA => Just checking out the lights.
BILL => Pretty, ain't they?
STARLA => I don't know. I've seen them so many times before. I guess any spot gets boring after awhile.
BILL => Well that's only if you're in the wrong spot.
BILL => There's a place over there on the bluffs. When the fog is just right, like tonight, the lights of Main look like a kaleidoscope.
STARLA => Oh, yeah?
BILL => Mm hm. But only a few folks know how to get there. Wally. Rollo Linkski coulda taken you, but 'course he got hit by that train. Me.
STARLA => I'll get Wally to show me sometime then.
BILL => Oh, will you now?
STARLA                            GRANT => Or Rollo's ghost.               Starla.
STARLA => Grant, where'd you go?
BILL => Hey, Grant.
GRANT => You ready, sugarplum?
STARLA => Bye.
WALLY => Surprised you're able to lift a mug after carrying that torch for so long.
BILL => Hey, Wally. Glad you're here. There was something I wanted to tell you...
WALLY => What?
BILL => Oh yeah.     Fuck you, fat ass.
MARGARET => Sir, may I help -- ?
BRENDA'S HUSBAND => My wife, Brenda. I think something has happened to her!
STARLA => Grant?
STARLA => Damn fuse.
STARLA => Grant?
STARLA => Grant, where are y -- ?
STARLA => Grant. Oh my God. What happened to your -- ?
GRANT => Heh. It ain't as bad as it looks, sugarplum. Dr. Carl was just here. I had a reaction to a bee sting. He gave me a prescription. Said I should be fine, in a couple days.
GRANT => Don't look at me like that, baby. Please? I'm gonna go get my... prescription filled.
STARLA => I'll get if for you.
GRANT => No!   No.   Heh.     I'll be right back.
BRENDA => Grant? Grant, I'm hungry. I'm so fuckin' hungry I think I'm gonna die.
GRANT => Brought you munchies.
GRANT => Been saving for a rainy day.
BRENDA => Grant, I'm sorry if I did something wrong! I think I gotta -- I think I should go to a hospital!
WALLY => Grant around?
STARLA => No.   He went to the pharmacy.
WALLY => Pharmacy?
STARLA => He's got a... rash.
BILL => Starla, you know Brenda Gutierrez?
BILL => Maybe she's ever called the house, or -- ?
STARLA => No.   What...?
BILL => She disappeared Friday night. We got reason to believe foul play might be involved.
WALLY => Some kids found her necklace near Tipper Creek, as well as what might be her blood on a rock.
BILL => The problem, Starla, is, the last person anyone saw her talking to was Grant.
BILL => The Deer Cheer. And Wally and me, we also saw him that night, with mud all over his slacks.
BILL => Have him call me right away, okay?
SHERRY => You've reached Chief Pardy at the Wheelsy Police Department. Please leave a message and your call will be returned as soon as possible.
STARLA => Bill, it's Starla!
STARLA => It's -- I think you better come over right away -- I think Grant's sick, he --
GRANT => Why'd you betray me, sugarplum?!
STARLA => Grant, no!
GRANT => I loved you.     I loved --
STARLA => Grant, you're sick!
GRANT => I wanted you by my side, but you -- I can't trust you now!
STARLA => Noooo!
BILL => Starla?!!   Starla, are you in there?!
BILL => Starla?!
TREVOR => Fuck!
PASTOR => Jesus, these past few days have been a trying time for us.
PASTOR => We ask you now for the safe return of our beloved Brenda.
PASTOR => Our sister. Our daughter.    Our mother. Our wife.
PASTOR => And we ask that you keep your light alive in her heart, wherever she may be. We ask all this in your name, Lord. Amen
BILL                               CONGREGATION => Amen.                            Amen.
BILL => Starla.
BILL => I talked to the CDC. They didn't have nothin' on file consistent with Grant's... symptoms.
STARLA => How about Brenda?
BILL => New? No. We're hoping we find Grant, he'll lead us to her.
BILL => You all right?
STARLA => Yeah.
JACK => Bill!
BILL => Shit.
JACK => Bill, we need to talk!
BILL => 'Mornin', Jack.
JACK => Bill, this Brenda's Randy Flagg's niece. We need to find Grant yesterday! The town council has lit a Roman candle and stuck it up my ass!
BILL => Hell, Jack, your leisure activities ain't my business.
JACK => Don't fuck with me, Bill. Your post here as Chief is in dire straits you don't work this shit out.
BILL => Don't worry, we'll find him.  Anything new?
JACK => How are you going to find him?
BILL => Dude's a half-squid. Ain't many places he can hide. Sea World, maybe.
JACK => That young lady heard you say 'squid.' She's gonna go out and create a Goddamn hysteria!
BILL => Sherry, you gonna create a hysteria?
SHERRY => Not today, Bill.
JACK => Still, quit that talk! You yourself said it was dark in there! You don't know what you saw!
TREVOR => We saw his arm was all bendy.
JACK => Bastard obviously got lyme disease!
BILL => What?
JACK => Touch some deer feces out in the forest. Eat a sandwich without washing your hands. Then you got lyme disease.
BILL => And that makes you look like a squid?
JACK => I'll tell you what, no one with lyme disease gonna win any damn handsome contests!
JACK => Well, screw you all for laughin'.
SHELBY => Bill!
SHELBY => Another ranch attack!   Up at the Castavets'.
JACK => 'Ranch a -'?   What 'ranch attacks'?
WALLY => It looks like one of them psyche tests. What do they call it?
BILL => Rorschach.
WALLY => What do you see? I see a butterfly.
BILL => I see we're fucked.   Three ranches in three days.
MARGARET => So, I think I got it part-way figured. You want to hear it?
MARGARET => So Grant -- I mean, we're saying this is Grant, right?
MARGARET => Grant kills a cow right about here. See there's the blood, musta slit its neck.
MARGARET => So he drags the cow backwards here. Only he prolly didn't know 'bout the Castavets had them dogs.
TREVOR => Hey, look!
TREVOR => He knocked this'n's head clear over here!
WALLY => Put that down, numbnuts!
MARGARET => So the dogs attacked, somehow he slew 'em all, and he stole off with the cow into the forest.
BILL => He's gotta be in the forest. All three ranches run alongside it.
TREVOR => Think we should get up a search party, head in there?
WALLY => It's a hundred thousand acres. Be finding a needle in a fuckstack.
BILL => Wally, come on. Trevor and Margaret, get some folks together. I think I know where he's gonna hit next.
BILL => So the night after Grant ran off, a calf went missing from here, the Raglans' ranch.
BILL => Two nights ago, a mare was stolen from this property, run by Fitzgibbon, that old rancher with the cleft palate.
WALLY => Looks like a chipmunk.
BILL => Your momma wasn't too proud when you came out neither, Wally.
BILL => And then we get here, the Castavets', where last night's shit-storm took place.
TREVOR => I see. It's like as if he's going in a pattern. Is that what you're saying, Bill?
BILL => And if he sticks to that pattern he'll be here next. Belongs to a family, the Strutemyers'. Now I know y'all are tired and you've barely seen your families. But we're gonna have to go there tonight, lie low and wait.
REDNECK => Let's get that son-of-a-bitch, Chief.
BILL => Just remember, we don't know what we're up against here. So let's be careful.
TREVOR => Hey, Bill, we got that grenade we confiscated from them jokers wanted to use it fish for trout?
BILL => Can't hurt.
JACK => I didn't know the Russkies were invading there, folks.
MARGARET => You seen this guy, you'd wished they was.
STARLA => Bill, I heard what you're doing. I think I should go along.
BILL => Why? Listen, it doesn't matter. I gotta go.
STARLA => Wait! Dammit, Bill, if that girl's still out there, how will you find her? How, unless you bring Grant in alive? Your best chance of doing that is with me. I can talk to him --
BILL => He tried to kill you, Starla.
STARLA => He did. I know. But I got him angry 'cause I wasn't calm. This time I could --
STARLA => Please, Bill. What happened, it's my fault, I know it.
BILL => Starla, it ain't --
STARLA => It is. He'd been acting strange. And the physical changes. I should have told someone right away... But I was just blind. I wanted to pretend it wasn't happening... If I don't do what I can to help now, I just couldn't live with it.
KYLIE'S MOM => Kylie! What'd you do to your fingers?
KYLIE => Kiri Goshima done 'em.    She's Japanese.
KYLIE'S DAD => Looks like Pokemons done 'em to me!
KYLIE => Foreign stuff is classy if you knew something.
KYLIE'S DAD => Oh. There's Jack. I want y'all to stay inside tonight. All right?
JACK => This turns out to be a mountain lion we're gonna look like a damn bunch of idiots.
REDNECK => Didn't know it was date night.
REDNECK => I'll be expecting you toss my salad at the end of all this then, Charlie.
BILL => Hey, Starla, remember that time when you were a kid and you came knocking on my window in the middle of the night?
BILL => Starla here's twelve. Guess I was fourteen. I said, 'Starla, what the hell you doing out there?' She tells me she's running away to Hollywood to become a big star. She said she knew I was in ROTC, and she was gonna need a bodyguard. Invited me along.
BILL => I said, 'Starla, if there's anybody can take care of herself, I think it's you. I'm gonna have to decline.'
WALLY =>  How far'd you get?
STARLA => About the bus stop. Ranger Rick here called my dad.
WALLY => Ha! A cop from the get-go!   You son-of-a-bitch!
STARLA => You fucked up our fame and fortune, Bill Pardy.
BILL => Yeah, maybe I did.
STARLA => Grant?
JACK => You said 'squid'!
TREVOR => It got worse.
WALLY => What we gonna do now, Bill?   Cuffs won't even fit on 'im.
BILL => Starla, where you...?
STARLA => Grant?
STARLA => Grant?   It's okay.
STARLA => You're just sick is all. But we'll take you to get help right now. I'll stay by your side, Grant, just like I swore I would. For better or worse. Remember?
STARLA => Okay?
STARLA => Okay, Grant?    It's gonna be all right.
BILL => Fire!   Fire!
WALLY => There he is!     Over there!
TREVOR => Where'd he go?
MARGARET => We ain't never gonna find that girl now.
REDNECK => I'll kill that asshole what he did to Charlie.
BILL => Starla, get the hell out of here!
MARGARET => Bill!!
TREVOR => What the hell's that smell?
WALLY => It's something dead.
JACK => It's coming from in there, ain't it?
MARGARET => Think he's inside?
BILL => Oh...
OLDER COP => Oh, shit!
BRENDA => Something's wrong with me.
WALLY => Uh, yeah.
BILL => Brenda, um...
BRENDA => I didn't want no one to be seeing me like this.
BRENDA => How are my boys, Bill?    Are they all right?
BILL => Boys are fine, Brenda. Uh, what's -- what's happening here, exactly?
BRENDA => I'm so fucking hungry, Bill. I'm so hungry. I just never knew anybody could be so hungry.
BRENDA => Would you mind handing me a piece of that possum there at your feet? Little bit?
BILL => I think we best get you to a hospital right quick.
WALLY => What the fuck they gonna do with her in a hospital, Bill?
OLDER COP => Why's she doing that?!
REDNECK => Her tumors is moving.
JACK => Bill, get her to stop that shit!
BRENDA => It hurts!
BRENDA => Help me!!     Help!!
STARLA => Bill!
BRENDA => Little fuckers are tearing me aparrrr- !
BILL => He led us here.
BILL => Margaret, cover your mouth!
BILL => Don't let 'em in your mouths!
TREVOR => They wanted us to eat 'em!   Why would they want that!?
KYLIE'S MOM => Kylie! You're gonna turn into a plum in there!
KYLIE => Prune, Mom.    Plums turn into prunes.
KYLIE'S MOM => I know what turns into what. You got school tomorrow. Finish up in there and get to bed.
KYLIE'S MOM => Time to turn in, ladies.
KYLIE'S MOM => Come on now.
KYLIE'S MOM => G'night.
KYLIE'S MOM => Sleep tight.   Don't let the bed bugs bite.
KYLIE => Mom!!
KYLIE => Mom!!!
KYLIE => Mom!!    Mom!!!
KYLIE => Emily!!    Jenna!!
KYLIE => No!!   Nooo!!
BILL => 11-41. We're gonna need paramedics out here right away. We got four men down.
BILL => Shelby, you there?
BILL => Shelby, this is Bill.     We got an emergency here.
BILL => Goddammit.
BILL => Shelby?
MARGARET => Is he alive?
MARGARET => Praise Jesus.
TREVOR => 'Praise Jesus?' That's fucking pushing it, Margaret.
TREVOR => What the hell were those things?! You ever seen anything like that? You ever heard of anything like that?
TREVOR => Me neither. And I watch 'Animal Planet' all the fuckin' time!
BILL => No reception out here.
STARLA => Bill, I'll run out to your car, call for paramedics from there.
MARGARET => That's a long ways. Them worms are out there.
STARLA => I'll keep my mouth covered.
BILL => No. I'll go. The three of you, you wait here. Get these folks, out of the barn. The stench and rot can't be any good for 'em.
STARLA => Be careful, Bill.
TREVOR => It's got to be some Goddamn biological weapons. Government's testin' 'em out on us! 'Cause who gives a shit if Wheelsy disappears, right?!
TREVOR => I hope it ain't contagious. I'll be pissed as hell I turn into a big mollusk. I'll fuckin' sue, I swear to God.
WALLY => Hey, sugarplum.
STARLA => What?
WALLY => Marriage. It's a sacred bond. Just like you said.
WALLY => I'm sorry 'bout trying to strangle you and all. I lost -- Lost my head. I didn't want to do none of the things I done. Not kill them pets. Not make Brenda a womb. But it's my nature, ain't it? How can you blame a one for actin' according to his nature?
WALLY => I wanted to tell you what was going on. But I didn't - didn't think you'd love me no more. I never knew... love, Starla, I --
MARGARET => Wally?
MARGARET => You all right?
MARGARET => Maybe you better sit back down. You don't look so good.
TREVOR => Margaret.
KYLIE'S DAD => Kylie, honey, you okay? Come on out.
KYLIE'S MOM => Open the door, sweetie. I know we don't look so good, but your mommy and daddy love you.
KYLIE => Get away!!
KYLIE'S MOM => Now, Kylie, there's no excuse why not to be with your family. This is family fun day, isn't it?
BILL => Hey!
BILL => What's -- ?
BILL => What's going on here?
KYLIE'S DAD => Well, hello there, Pardy.
BILL => What happened to you, Dwight?
KYLIE'S DAD => Poison ivy out back, maybe?
KYLIE'S SISTERS => We're itchy!
KYLIE => They're not my... They killed...
BILL => Okay. Y'all just wait in this spot. I'm gonna call the paramedics for you. Kylie can come with --
RANCHER => Hey there, killer.
BILL => Come on.
MARGARET => Now, what'd I say?! Y'all just sit down! You need to get some Goddamn rest! You're sick!
TREVOR => Let go!!
MARGARET => It burns!!
MARGARET => What'd you do to my fuckin' hand?!
OLDER COP => Meat.
STARLA => Let him go!
STARLA => Trevor, come on.
STARLA => What'd you do to her?!
JACK => There you go, sugarplum! Why you choosing camps 'fore you hear --
JACK                            REDNECK => Both sides of the story!?       Both sides of the story!?
STARLA => Why are you talking like Grant?!
WALLY => 'Cause I am Grant!
WALLY                           REDNECK => I'm you husband --              I'm you husband, Goddammit --
JACK => You swore to honor and obey --
STARLA => Don't come any closer.    I'll... shoot.
WALLY => You ain't gonna shoot me! You always needed me to protect you! You for damn sure ain't got the balls to --
TREVOR => Oh shit oh shit oh shit oh shit!
BILL => Shit.   Ammo's in the trunk.
BILL => Trevor!   Margaret!
TREVOR => They killed Margaret!
BILL =>  Where are you?!
TREVOR => We're coming your way, man!
KYLIE => Go!   Go!   Please!
BILL => My friends are still in the forest.
BILL => We need their weight.
BILL => Dumbshits.
BILL => Come on!
OLDER COP => Starla!!
BILL => Shelby?
BILL => Shelby, you there?
SHELBY => Yo, Chief.   How y'all doin'?
SHELBY => You dig that rat out of the hole?
BILL => Listen, you got any reports of... I don't know what you call 'em. They look like big slugs, only fast.
SHELBY => Slugs? No. 'Less you talkin' about that new waitress down at Sloan's! Ha ha!
BILL => Shelby --
SHELBY => Oh, shit! I hope she ain't a police radio aficionado. If so, I apolog -
BILL => Shelby, shut up. Keep an eye out for these things. If you see 'em, keep your mouth covered. Otherwise they'll go straight down it. All right?
BILL => Are you nodding?
SHELBY => Yeah.
BILL => I can't hear when you're nodding.
SHELBY => Sorry.
BILL => We'll be there in ten minutes.
KYLIE => The worms are in their brains.
KYLIE => Drivin' 'em around...
STARLA => She's right. We saw one -- one came out of Wally's head.
TREVOR => Yeah. Sort of his eye, it came out there --
STARLA => Kylie, how do you --
STARLA => Kylie, how do you know that?
BILL => Kylie, honey.    Please. 
BILL => A lot of bad things have happened to you today, we know. But we need your help to find out what's going on.
KYLIE => I was in the bath. It tried to go inside me and I -- for a minute I became it.
BILL => The worm?
KYLIE => I got it out.
TREVOR => What are they?
KYLIE => Part of him.
BILL => Who?  Who?
KYLIE => Mrs. Grant's husband.
KYLIE => But not always. I was -- He was... other stuff too.
STARLA => What other stuff?
TREVOR => He's a fucking Martian?!
BILL => A Martian is from Mars, Trevor.
KYLIE => For real it looks like a needle. Its real face. But it always gots another. 
KYLIE => He goes from place to place, worlds... planets... killing 'em. He takes over half of what's alive and eats the other half. Till they're gone.
KYLIE => Now he's here.     He went in Mr. Grant.
STARLA => Through a wound on his stomach?
KYLIE => He took him over. His body. His -- his brain, everything what he knew. He's only been dumb stuff before - amoeba-things, and rhino-things. He liked being human. Didn't want to change.
STARLA => And you said the worms are part of him. They're all linked, like one creature?
KYLIE => When one sees you they all see you.
STARLA => An animal that doesn't procreate. It spreads, grows. A living disease.
BILL =>  So the way to stop this thing is to stop Grant?
BILL => Shit.
BILL => Shelby, we broke down on 22, a mile outside town. Come pick us up.
SHELBY => I got to leave my post.
BILL => Do it.
BILL => Hey, Starla.
BILL => Was always curious why you... married Grant in the first place... Just never seemed outta love.
STARLA => I know what people say, Bill. I... Remember, back in high school I worked at my father's gas station?
STARLA => Grant used to get filled up every day. I knew it was just to see me. He was too old -- But he was handsome. And he had that big ol' Lincoln then. I flirted with him.
BILL => Well, big ol' Lincoln, sure. Guess I would have flirted with him too.
STARLA => My father, he was -- he was real close to evil. People didn't know. Still don't. From the time I was a toddler he'd beat the hell out of me. I don't mean just like a smack for smart-mouthing... he took a real enjoyment in it. And when I turned eleven or twelve, things... well, they got worse.
BILL => When you wanted to run away, I called your dad.
STARLA => That wasn't a good night, no.
BILL => I'm sorry.
STARLA => Anyway, Grant rolls in one day. I fill his tank with like an eighth- a-gallon as usual. And he notices my lip's all swollen up, and starts asking me how it happened. I don't know why I chose then, why Grant -- I guess I saw an opportunity. And I told him everything, first time I told anyone. Grant was furious. He picked up a tire iron, walked straightaway into the garage, and beat my father half to death. You say it's not about love, Bill. But that was the closest thing to it I ever knew.
STARLA => Grant asked me to marry him a few weeks later. I felt... safe with him.
STARLA => After all this shit tonight, I know for sure now you regret not running off with me to Hollywood!
BILL => Hell, Starla.    I always regretted that.
TREVOR => Don't worry, kid. Pretty soon, we'll be in town, everything'll be fine.
STARLA => What's that?
TREVOR => They musta hit a deer. Probably got out to see if it's okay.
BILL => Fuck me.
TREVOR => Bambi-rats!
STARLA => Get in!
BILL => Shelby!
TREVOR => When I buy my zoo, I'm leaving them things the hell out!
BILL => Shelby!
SHELBY => Hey there, Chief.
BILL => Shelby! We need people out here at Cosgrove and McCammon right away!
SHELBY => Don't worry, Chief.
SHELBY => Already on our way.
DISEASED TOWNSFOLK => Starrrrrlaaaaaa!!
BILL => Come on.
TREVOR => What the hell are we going to do?!
BILL => Just block the doors, any way you can.
TREVOR => Goddamn snakes!!
STARLA => This is stupid.
BILL => What are you doing?!
STARLA => We can't make it. Just get away, when you get the chance.
BILL => What?
STARLA => He wants me, Bill! I'm going to get him to take me to him! See if you can follow me, and kill him!
BILL => No, Starla!   No!
BILL => Nooo!
SMASHED-FACE MAN => You said for better or worse! You lied!
BRENDA'S HUSBAND => You like Pardy better'n me? That's who you want to screw now?!
STARLA => Grant... Please...
STARLA => I'm sorry... I know I haven't behaved how you -- how you want. I know. Don't... hurt... me.
STARLA => We need... to... talk.
STARLA => Not here, though, okay? Not all of you. I'm not used to -- I want to talk to your face, Grant. Your more real face. Your --
SMASHED-FACE MAN => Pardy?!!   Where are you, Pardy!!
PASTOR => We've surrounded the town, you prick! Ain't no way outta here!
STARLA => Grant?
STARLA => Grant?   We should talk.
STARLA => Grant?
STARLA => Hey, Grant.
STARLA => You did some real interesting decorating here.
STARLA => Hey.
STARLA => Look, the sun's starting to come up.
STARLA => Sorry. I didn't -- I didn't know you wanted it dark.
STARLA => You like these memories, huh, Grant?
STARLA => You like being called Grant, don't you?
STARLA => I think you do. You really do. You like being Grant. Like when we danced. And when you... made love to me here on the bed. Remember that?
STARLA => I know you've been alone, Grant. Almost forever. From here to there to there to here, there's never been another one for you.
STARLA => Grant. Grant, I could help you. Be with you the way you want. See, I want to live. I've never had much use for this world, not really. You and I, together, we --
STARLA => You don't trust me, I know. That's why I brought you someone, Grant.
STARLA => It's Bill. He's in the house next door. Just look.
STARLA => See? I brought him here for you! As an offering! To prove I love you more than him!
STARLA => Now, Bill!!   Kill the motherfucker!!
GRANT => Er...?
STARLA => Hey.
BILL => Hey.
BILL => Starla, over here.
STARLA => We can probably get some first aid and food at this gas station up here.
BILL => Yeah.   Good.
CASHIER => Comes to 32.87.
BILL => There you go.
STARLA => Shit. I- I forgot... I wanted to get aspirin.
BILL => I'll get it for you.      Ibuprofen or aspirin?
STARLA => Aspirin.
BILL => We'll just head up here into Bishopville, get checked up in the hospital. Then maybe we'll head off to Hollywood after all, huh?
STARLA => Okay.
BILL => Please, Starla. I'm gonna do my best not to hurt anybody --
STARLA => You took Bill.
BILL => It's my nature.
STARLA => And this is mine.
