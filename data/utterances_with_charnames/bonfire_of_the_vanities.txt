MARIA => Neither did I. So if the question ever comes up, all that happened was, two boys blocked the road and tried to rob us and we got away. That's all we know. They go into... climbing the stairs.
SHERMAN => But if we called the police now... MARIA Yes, let's call them and invite them over here to our little love nest. They would love to get their hands on us. The police and the press and all the rest of the 'mediarites.' SHERMAN Meteorites?
SHERMAN => I'd just feel better if... Maria drops everything and turns on him... MARIA You don't have to feel better, Sherman. I was the one who was driving. And I'm saying I didn't hit anybody, and I'm not reporting anything to the police! And if you are a gentleman, you will support me in that decision. Silence. They are both out of breath.

Which means, loosely translated, that you have no evidence. KRAMER Your Honor, the District Attorney, Mr. Weiss... JUDGE WHITE                           * I know who the district attorney is. I know Mr. Weiss. And the only reason Mr. Weiss is interested in the case is because Mr. Williams over there is a white man who lives in a nice big house in Riverdale. KRAMER I don't follow, sir... JUDGE WHITE                           * Because this is an election year. Because ninety-nine percent of the people you shovel through here are black and the other ninety-nine percent don't even speak English. But they do vote. 
JUDGE WHITE => So you go tell your boss, the district attorney, Captain Ahab Weiss that I know he's out there looking for the great white defendent... but Mr. Williams over there is not it.

RAY => So why are you coming to us? You got a victim who's unconscious, you got no witness, no driver -- you got what we call here a piece of shit. Ain't that right, Mr. Kramer? Martin and Goldberg look at each other.

BACON => On Bruckner Boulevard. Innocently walking along, minding his own business... A clear case of hit-and-run. 
BACON => You got what he told his mother. KRAMER That's hearsay. You may believe it and I may believe it, but it's not admissable in a court of law. BACON If this boy was born on Park Avenue and he was run down by two niggers in a Pontiac Firebird, then you'd have a case! Wouldn't you?! MARTIN I work Park Avenue and I work Bruckner Boulevard, Reverend. There's good and bad in both places. Now we'll do everything we can for this lady. But we don't have a hell of a lot to go on.

No response. => SHERMAN Have you ever thought, I mean, what if we moved out of New York? What do you think? JUDY About what? 
SHERMAN => My father did it. JDUY You are not your father. PETER FALLOW She knew how to hurt a guy. No. He was nothing like his father. His father, the lion of Dunning, Sponget and Leach. His father, who took the subway to work every day of his life. His father, who still believed in principals and ethics, whose repeated lessons concerning duty, debt and responsibility had whistled through his son's head. No. Sherman McCoy was nothing like his father.
MRS. McCOY => ... And she said to me, 'I like my older customers best of all. They're the only ones who drink anymore.'
Everyone laughs. => MRS. McCOY 'My older customers!'
MR. McCOY => She thought you were twenty-five.  All of a sudden I'm married to a white ribbon. 
CAMPBELL => But what's a bond?
MRS. McCOY =>  Oh, yes, Sherman, do explain it.
MR. McCOY => Yes. Your mother and I really want to hear this, Sherman. SHERMAN A bond is a way of lending   people money.  Let's say you want   to build a road or a hospital   and you need a lot of money. Well,    you issue a bond... CAMPBELL Do you build roads?
SHERMAN => No, I don't actually build them... MR. McCOY I think you're in over your head. More laughter.
JUDY => Here. Let me try. Darling, Daddy doesn't build roads or hospitals or anything, really. Daddy just handles the bonds for the people who raise the money. CAMPBELL That's what he said. Bonds.
JUDY => Yes. See, just imagine that a bond is a slice of cake. Now you didn't bake that cake, but every time you hand somebody a slice of that cake, a little bit comes off, little crumbs fall off. And you're allowed to keep those crumbs. 
MR. McCOY =>  And many a man has sold his soul for those little crumbs.
JUDY =>  Yes. And that's what Daddy does. He passes somebody else's cake around and picks up the crumbs. But you have to imagine a lot of crumbs. And a great golden cake. And a lot of golden crumbs. And you have to imagine Daddy running around picking up every little golden crumb he can get his hands on. That's what Daddy does. SHERMAN Well, you can call them crumbs if you want to... JUDY That's the best I can do.   Excuse me.
Then... => MR. McCOY Of course, in my day, there was some integrity to it...
SHERMAN => Yes.   Well... MR. McCOY Now it's not about anything, is it? Except the money. SHERMAN I don't make the rules.
MR. McCOY => All the more reason not to play the game.
SHERMAN => We're having a little... It's nothing serious. Really.
PETER => Of course, up to this point in our story, I was blissfully ignorant. I had no idea of the storm that was gathering. Never even heard of Sherman McCoy.

PETER => He was seriously injured. I'm a journalist. I write for a newspaper. RIFKIN Oh.   I don't remember him.
PETER => What I would like to find out is what kind of student he was. RIFKIN Well, if I don't remember him, I guess he was okay. PETER Would you say he was a 'good' student? RIFKIN 'Good' doesn't really apply to Ruppert High. They're either cooperative or life-threatening. There's no in-between.
PETER => His mother says he was considering going to college.
RIFKIN => Well, she means City College. They have an open admissions policy. So, if you live in the city and you graduate from high school and you're still breathing, they have to take you. 
PETER => Fallow.
RIFKIN => I got sixty-five students in every class...
PETER => Do you have any of his written work? RIFKIN Oh, Jesus, there hasn't been any written work at Ruppert High since... oh, fifteen years. Maybe twenty. PETER Well, there must be some record of how he measures up to the others... RIFKIN No. See, you're thinking about grades and honor students and high achievers. We don't make those kinds of comparisons. We're just trying to keep them off the street. At Ruppert High, an honor student is somebody who comes to class and doesn't piss on the teacher.

SHERMAN Well, I mean, if you have a routine in an investigation like this -- I don't know how these things work, but there must also be a routine for a person like me, an owner of a car with a license number -- I think that's what I need to consider. The routine. MARTIN We just want to look at the car. SHERMAN That's what I mean. You see?
MARTIN => No. GOLDBERG Excuse me, Mr. McCoy. But is there something you want to tell us? 
GOLDBERG => Because, if there is, now is the time to tell us. Before things get complicated.
SHERMAN => No. I just think... I think that, just to be sure, certain, safe... I think... GOLDBERG Let me put it this way, if you want to cooperate, that's great. If you have reasons for not cooperating, then I should tell you that you don't have to say anything. That's your right. If you want, you can say nothing at all. You also have the right to an attorney. I mean, for that matter, if you lacked the 'funds' for an attorney, the state would provide you with one -- free of charge.   If that's what you wanted.
SHERMAN => Well, look. I guess what I should do is, I should... I should talk this over with an attorney. EVENING is moving fast as he talks with Martin and Goldberg.
GOLDBERG => ... But mainly, it's the look on his face. Ain't that the truth, Marty?
MARTIN => Yeah. All of sudden, the bitch starts coming out of him.
GOLDBERG => So I read him his rights -- as casual as I can do it.  )O(    BONFIRE OF THE VANITIES - Rev. 4/26/90                    67          *
MARTIN => And then he sits down on the guy's desk. KRAMER What'd he do?
GOLDBERG => Nothin' at first. But he's confused. And his eyes are getting bigger and he's double-talking like a son of a bitch. I'm thinking there's something there. CUT TO:
KRAMER => I think we got him. WEISS Got who?   What do you got?
GOLDBERG => Well... KRAMER McCoy.    Sherman McCoy.   We got him. WEISS You think it's him? MARTIN Well, we think so, yeah, but... KRAMER It's him. We got him. This guy is Park Avenue. His old man ran Dunning, Sponget and Leach. He's got his name in the columns. His wife is a fucking socialite. WEISS Does this put an end to this white justice shit?
KRAMER => I'll tell you what you got to do, sir. You've got to send a signal out to the poor people of this city. You got to let them know that justice is blind. You got to let them know that if you're white and rich, you get the same treatment you get when you're black and poor. You got to give people hope! WEISS You mean, we nail the wasp. KRAMER To the wall.
WEISS => I like this man. I like him. Look. What's the kid's condition? Any chance he'll regain consciousness? RAY What if he does? He can't talk. He's breathing from a tube down his throat.
WEISS => No.   But maybe he can point. RAY Point?
KRAMER => Might work. That might work. It's a long shot, but it might work.
AIDE => Mr. Kramer? KRAMER Yeah?   What do you want?
RAY =>  You'll kill him. He wakes up out of a coma and sees four white men in suits and ties staring at him from the end of the bed, he'll shit and die. WEISS It's worth a try. RAY I don't believe what I'm hearing! Some poor gook with a tube down his throat pointing at a picture. That's your case?! It's never gonna stand up.
WEISS =>  I know that, Ray. I know that. I just want to bring the guy in! Just bring him in. That's all. We get the press. We get the attention. Then we can relax and do the right thing.
RAY => Look at me, Abe. Watch my mouth. Read my lips. No. We cannot do that. No way. 
KRAMER => I think we got a witness.
WEISS =>  What?! What?!!
KRAMER => I think we got a mother-fucking witness!!!
HAYDEN => ... So I walk up to him and I say, hello, I'm from Legal Aid, I'm your lawyer. And he says, 'Fuck you, mother. I don't want no nigger lawyer. I want a Jew.' KRAMER Nice guy. HAYDEN This is his third drug arrest. He wants a deal.
KRAMER => And he'll say he was there, at the scene? HAYDEN He'll say whatever you want him to say. 179   CLOSE ON ROLAND                                              179 CUT TO:

KILLIAN => I believe you. It was a set-up. They were going to take you off. Sounds to me like he's got good reasons not to come forward. You just sit tight. That's what you do.
SHERMAN => It means I want to take the initiative. I want to go to the police with Maria -- Mrs. Ruskin -- and just tell them exactly what happened. I mean, I don't know about the law, but I feel morally certain that we did what was right -- in the situation we were in. And I don't see... KILLIAN Ayyyy! You Wall Street honchos are real gamblers. Ayyy! Whaddaya whaddaya! They would devour you. They would eat you up. SHERMAN But why? KILLIAN Forget it's already a political football. Forget the T.V. and Reverend Bacon and Weiss has an election coming up. Forget that and remember that when you work in the D.A.'s office and every day you prosecute people with names like Tiffany Latour and Sancho Rodriguez and Chong Wong and Shabazz Kazan Tamali, you are dying to get your hands on a nice white couple like you and Mrs. Ruskin. Biscuit city, ehhh! You open your mouth and they will arrest you. And they will make a big show out of arresting you. And it will be very unpleasant.
KILLIAN => That is guaranteed. Believe me, you do not want to be arrested in the South Bronx.  Yeah. Oh. Put him on. Yeah? I'll hold.  I need to talk to your friend, Mrs. Ruskin, too. SHERMAN I understand you went to Yale.
KILLIAN => Yeah.     You, too. Huh? SHERMAN What did you think of it? KILLIAN It was okay. As law schools go. They give you the scholarly view. You know. It's terrific for anything you want to do -- as long as it doesn't involve real people.  Hey, Andruitti, you guinea, how are you? Yeah. Well, I'm sitting here with Sherman McCoy. Yeah. That's right. Well, I don't know if he needs a lawyer. What do you think? (winks at Sherman and smiles) Uh-huh. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.  So what does that mean? Okay. Yeah. Sure. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. He puts down the phone and looks at Sherman.

I have a previous appointment. JUDY  Sherman. Please. What is the matter with you? You're not even dressed and the car is already here.
SHERMAN => What?  What car?  No, Rawlie, I can't change it.
JUDY => Leon and Inez Bavardage. They are taking us to the opera. Eight o'clock. Tonight. And the car is here. SHERMAN Rawlie, I'll call you later. Just stay calm.  But why do we need a car? They only live six blocks from here.
SHERMAN => We could walk.
JUDY => I can't walk down the street in this dress. A small wind would turn me into a kite.
SHERMAN => Then let's take a taxi. JUDY Why are we having this conversation?
SHERMAN => Because a car is going to take us six blocks and wait there for five and a half hours and then drive us another six blocks home and it is going to cost us three hundred and forty-six dollars?! We are hemorrhaging money, Judy. It is pouring out of us with every beat of our heart. Isn't that worth talking about?!? Judy sits down and thinks. JUDY You're right. It might be cheaper in the long run to hire a permanent chauffeur. SHERMAN Judy, please...
JUDY => We'll talk about it later.
SHERMAN => We have to talk now. JUDY We can't hire a chauffeur in the next fifteen minutes. SHERMAN We haven't talked about anything for the last three weeks.
JUDY => Well there's no reason to start now. 
JUDY => Sherman, this is a very important evening. It will determine whether or not I will be chairman of the museum benefit this year. I cannot be upset now. We can talk about it later. SHERMAN I'm going to be arrested in the morning. JUDY Really, Sherman, you'd do anything to ruin this for me. Wouldn't you? Now please. Get dressed.

SHERMAN => Well, hi. BOBBY And what do you do, Mr. McCoy?
SHERMAN => Bonds. BOBBY Bonds. SHERMAN Bonds. BOBBY Well, the only bonds I know about are bail bonds. The group laughs and turns away from Sherman. BOBBY I was arrested last year in Montreal for pissing on a tree... As Judy tries to rejoin the group...
JUDY => Sherman, couldn't you try just once, to be a little bit interesting.
SHERMAN => I want you to meet Aubrey Buffing.
JUDY => Who?
SHERMAN => The poet. He's on the short list for the Nobel Prize. He has AIDS. You'll love him.
AUBREY => And even when repentence is offered, he refuses. He refuses to deny his life. The food, the drink, the flesh -- fatal as they may be -- he cannot resist them... Aubrey continues talking as he passes...

MARIA => He'll make a fortune.
SHERMAN => I don't think it will be too bad. My lawyer -- if you can call him that -- has received assurances that it will all be handled in an orderly fashion. MARIA He called me a whore today. Right in front of the servants. I mean, really. How does he expect me to run the house if he humiliates me in front of the help?
SHERMAN => Yes.   Well.   You have a point. MARIA I'm sorry, Sherman.    What are we talking about? SHERMAN The other guy has come forward. He says I was driving the car.

SALLY => What am I saying? Of course it's a bad time. But I just wanted to see if I can be of any help.
SALLY => You know I haven't been in this apartment since the McCleods had it. That was before the Kittridges. I hope I'm not being out of place. SHERMAN Not at all... uh... SALLY Sally.
SHERMAN => Anyway, thank you. SALLY No, really, anything I can do. With the apartment, is what I mean.
SHERMAN => The apartment? SALLY I find people often need to be as liquid as they can in these situations and I know I can get you seven-and-a-half right at this moment. Fabled aristocratic tycoon -- it's the celebrity appeal. Maybe eight. If we act quickly this kind of opportunity doesn't come along every day. You have to ride the wave. SHERMAN Excuse me.

POLLARD => Sorry to interrupt your dinner.
SHERMAN => Not at all.   The more the merrier. POLLARD I've been in touch with the co-op board, well, most of them, and we want you to know you have our support.
SHERMAN => You know, at first I wanted to die. Standing there in court, people calling my name... POLLARD Yes.   Of course. Hard to believe. SHERMAN And then I thought, I have a gun. Twelve gauge. Double barrel... FOLLOW them INTO...
SHERMAN => Here it is. POLLARD Sherman, we've known each other a long time. We went to Buckley together. My father knew your father. I speak as a friend. But also as president of the board. Is that a gun? SHERMAN I wonder if I can get both barrels into my mouth. That's what I was thinking. And how do you pull the trigger. I read somewhere about a man who took off his shoe and pulled the trigger with his toe.
POLLARD => Yes. This can't be a comfortable situation for you. 
POLLARD => Well...
SHERMAN => This is my home... POLLARD I understand that... SHERMAN This is the only safe place I have. People are threatening my life. I have to protect myself. He loads the gun and fills his pockets with shells. POLLARD There are people demonstrating in front of our building. Black people with basketballs! You're putting everyone at risk. It's not your fault. But that doesn't alter the facts. FOLLOW Sherman and Pollard OUT of the study TO...
SHERMAN => Alter the facts?! The facts are that I have no place else to go! And you want me to move out?! Is that what you're saying, Pollard. You want me to move out of my home?! The guests begin to listen to this exchange.
POLLARD => You are a shareholder in a cooperative. Look, we're not asking you to do anything of a permanent nature... 
SHERMAN => And you can start by moving out of this apartment right now. Out! Now!
POLLARD => I came here in good faith.
SHERMAN => Oh, Pollard, you were a ridiculous fat blowhard at Buckley and you're a ridiculous fat blowhard now. Everyone watches as Sherman holds Pollard at gunpoint and steers him out of the room. POLLARD I will have to enforce the provision concerning unacceptable situations. SHERMAN Another word out of you, Pollard, and there's going to be an unacceptable situation right up                          * your ass! Now march!                                     * The guests applaud.    Sherman turns to face them.

CAROLINE => The apartment was bugged. They had a wire in the intercom. They were trying to prove that I wasn't living there. Which I wasn't. Now I've lost the apartment and the boyfriend.
PETER => You don't know where they are? CAROLINE No. But I'm trusting you to find them. And when you do. Give them this. Tell them this is the little lady who turned them in. She takes one of the Xerox copies and hands it to Peter. Peter leaves. Caroline looks at the Xerox copy.

ARTHUR =>  My wife! My wife! I'm glad she's not here. Otherwise I couldn't have a drink.  Give me a Couvoisier V.S.O.P. No. Put it in a sidecar. PETER Yes.   Uh... where is Maria, by the way?
ARTHUR => Italy. Every time I turn around, she's in Italy. I'm not supposed to drink. But I love a sidecar. It was Willi Nordhoff introduced me to them. So. You're on the City Light? PETER Uh, yes. And we're doing a little profile piece. We're calling it the 'New Tycoons.' And, naturally, we thought of you.
ARTHUR => Good. Good. I like that. New tycoons. So what do you want to know? PETER Oh, there's no hurry. So Maria is in Italy. Where abouts?
ARTHUR => She's in Lake Como someplace.
PETER => Well, there are some great hotels in Lake Como. Is she at the Excelsior?

ARTHUR => ... But the best is just a few weeks ago, one of these jackass pilots, he lands long and the plane goes off the runway. I was there. I was on the plane. We're going into Mecca, see. And the plane is full of Arabs and all these animals -- sheep, goats, chickens. They won't travel without their animals. We had to put plastic in the cabins. You know, they urinate, they defecate... PETER Yes. ARTHUR Anyway, the plane goes off the runway and we hit the sand with a hell of a jolt and the right wing tip digs into the sand and the plane skids around in a circle! 360 degrees before we stop! We're scared shitless. Panic. And we look into the cabin and there's everybody calm, quiet, they're picking up their luggage and their animals and they're looking out the window at the little fire that started on the wing and they're waiting for the doors to open like nothing happened. And then it dawns on me. They think this is normal! He starts to laugh as he talks.
ARTHUR => They think this is the way you stop an airplane.

MAITRE D' => For your own protection and mine and my restaurant, we leave Monsieur Ruskin in the hands of God and we go back to our escargots. PETER Well, somebody has to do something. Peter tries to perform the Heimlich maneuver on Ruskin. MAITRE D' We have called the police. An ambulance is coming. There is nothing more we can do. Would you like some coffee or dessert?
MR. ROBERTS =>  Gee, buddy. I think he's dead. Peter lets go of Ruskin.    Ruskin slides to the floor -- dead. MAITRE D' Eh, voila. PETER Jesus.

MAITRE D' => The bill, monsieur. Thank you. And we do not accept credit cards.
PETER => Mrs. Ruskin? MARIA Yes?
PETER => My name is Peter Fallow. I just wanted to offer my sympathy. MARIA  How very kind. Did you know Arthur? PETER Ah, well, yes. I was actually quite close to him when he died. MARIA I've reprobated myself over and over again for being away...
PETER => You shouldn't.
MARIA => Well, thank you for the kind words. I must go now.
PETER => Yes. Just one other thing. I understand you're a friend of Sherman McCoy.
MARIA => I'm sorry...? 
MARIA => Sherman would never tell you that.

FOX => Right here. You see? It's the hospital that's the guilty party. PETER The hospital?! What are you talking about? FOX A young man comes in here with a cerebral concussion and they treat him for a broken wrist. That is our case! That is the lawsuit that we are going to bring against this hospital. That is what we have been working toward all this time. And you are confusing the issue! Do you understand me?!
PETER => Alright, alright. But Christ, Albert, this is a great story. This is my exclusive. And it's also the truth! BACON It's a little late for you to start telling the truth, isn't it, Pete? PETER I can't just drop this now.   I can't just let it go.
BACON => That's right. You're our boy, Peter. You take care of us and we'll take care of you. I promise you, that's going to be a very profitable relationship for all of us. Suddenly, Annie starts to weep.
BACON => Annie, I know that nothing can heal the wound that you have suffered. But ten million dollars in damages will certainly make your grief more comfortable. ANNIE Well, yes, I could use a few things, Reverend, thank you. I been worried about my clothes for instance. I feel that the presentation of my person should be carefully designed. As a model to black mothers everywhere, I think I should have the right wardrobe. So if you could have Mr. Fox's limousine pick me up in the morning, I could do some shopping.
FOX => Why certainly. ANNIE I'll need some furniture, too. And a new refrigerator. And although I should probably continue to live in that shithole of an apartment at least until after the lawsuit is settled, I would like to start looking now for a co-op in Manhattan -- for me and my son -- something with a view of the river and preferably in a neighborhood that is at least upwardly mobile.

A roar goes up from the crowd. 284   VARIOUS ANGLES - EVERYONE                                      284 Sherman and Killian at the defense table. In the audience, Bacon, Fox, Gerald Moore, Weiss and finally Peter Fallow taking notes. PETER And there it was. The end of Sherman McCoy. And it wasn't the                        * ending I was hoping for. He was                         * finished. She might as well have put a gun to his head and pulled the trigger. There was no hope now. The darkness closed in around him. And then I noticed the most peculiar thing. Sherman was smiling.
KRAMER => You were surprised? MARIA I was shocked. There are certain qualities of virtue that I admire in a human being, virtues that I hope I possess myself...
MARIA =>  We have time for a quickie.    What do you say, Sherman? SHERMAN  I don't feel terrifically sexy at the moment. White bangs his gavel. Everyone is looking around for                      * the source of the sound. JUDGE WHITE                                     * What in hell...?! MARIA  You know I'm a sucker for a soft dick.
SHERMAN =>  Maria, you are incorrigible.
MARIA => Am I?
SHERMAN =>  I supppose, we could still go to the police. We could get a very talented lawyer... 
DEMONSTRATORS =>  Whitewash!! Whitewash!! 
room. => 288   ANGLE - WHITE                                                   288   * rises on the bench like an eagle.    He pounds the gavel repeatedly.
DEMONSTRATORS => Justice. We want justice!!!   We want justice!!! JUDGE WHITE                                * Justice! You want justice?!   I'll give you justice! Finally, the courtroom goes quiet. White looks around.                * Everyone is quiet. And then a single VOICE rings out... VOICE You racist pig!
JUDGE => I'll tell you what justice is not. Justice is not the will of the few and it's not the will of the many. Justice is not politics. Justice is the law. And the law is man's feeble attempt to set down the principles of decency. Decency! And decency is not a deal. Or an angle, or a contract, or a hustle or a campaign or a trick or a bid for sympathy. Decency is not the beast that bays for money, power, dominion, position, votes and blood! Decency is what your mother taught you! Decency is in your bones! Do I make myself clear! Now go home. Go home now. Be decent people. Be decent. A moment of quiet as White comes down and faces Sherman. JUDGE You're free to go, Mr. McCoy. 289   ANGLE - COURTROOM                                            289 as another blood-curdling roar goes up from the crazed mob. They close in on the Judge and Sherman. 290   ANGLE - REVEREND BACON                                       290
BACON => You bald-headed Uncle Tom pussy!!                     * * Are you going to take this Park                       * Avenue justice!? Are you?                             *
KRAMER => We're not finished with you, McCoy. You'll be back in this courtroom. This decision will be appealed until I see you behind bars! You hear me, Judge. JUDGE Get your fucking face out of my way. KRAMER This fucking face is going to see you shining shoes in Grand Central Station. More pushing until...
KRAMER =>  This fucking face is going to see you selling pencils, you black son of a bitch. 
BACON => Sherman McCoy! You shall not escape. You shall live in fear on this island, in the mighty sea of people, for the people -- and justice -- are waiting for you! Sherman whacks Bacon. The choir women start to wail. Fox approaches Sherman offering his card.
FOX => You've been woefully misrepresented here, Mr. McCoy. I think you should give me a call... Sherman whacks Fox with the sword and continues down the corridor with the Judge. 296B   ANGLE - WEISS                                              296B giving an interview for a TV news team.
WEISS => ... and I promise you and the people of this city that Henry Lamb will not be forgotten. Henry Lamb will live, like the Alamo, as a symbol of slaughtered innocence.
WEISS => And this man's name will live in infamy. Like Adolf Hitler! Like Son of Sam! Like Idi Amin! John Wilkes Booth! Ted Bundy! Jesse Helms!
PETER => Oh, sorry. I'm Peter Fallow.      I'm Peter Fallow. Ha. Ha. Ha.
PETER => Thanks.   I needed that. 298    ANGLE - SHERMAN AND JUDGE                                     298
house. => 298A   EXT. COURTHOUSE - SHERMAN - DAY                               298A
SHERMAN => Are you alright?
JUDGE => I'm alright.   Damn hooligans. He walks up to the iron gates. The faces of the demon- strators are pressed against it. The Judge shakes a tired fist at them. Then he turns to Sherman. JUDGE And you. You, too. You go home now. And be decent. You hear me? SHERMAN I hear you, Your Honor.
PETER => It was the last I saw of Sherman McCoy...
PETER => And so we come to the end of our story. Sherman, you see, who started with so much, lost everything. But he gained his soul. Whereas I, you see, who started with so little, gained everything...

VOICE => ... the winner of the Pulitzer Prize, the National Book Award and just about every other prize you can win, ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Peter Fallow!!
podium. => PETER But what does it profit a man if he gains the whole world and loses ... Ah, well. There are compensations. Peter reaches the podium and faces a standing ovation. Cameras begin to flash. END CREDITS BEGIN. 305   SERIES OF STILL SHOTS                                         305
