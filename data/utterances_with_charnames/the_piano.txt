FLORA => My REAL father was a famous German composer
AUNT MORAG => Ohh the tag is broken.
FLORA => .... They met when my mother was an opera singer... in Luxemburg...
FLORA => Why?
FLORA => I want to be in the photograph.
STEWART => Beautiful.
AUNT MORAG => I thought she met your father in Luxemburg.
FLORA => Well, yes, in Austria where be conducted the Royal Orchestra.
AUNT MORAG => And where did they get married?
FLORA =>  In an enormous forest, with real fairies as bridesmaids each holding a little elf's hand.
FLORA => No, I tell a lie, it was in a small country church, near the mountains
AUNT MORAG => Which mountains are those dear?
FLORA => The Alps.
AUNT MORAG => Ohhh I've never been there. 
FLORA => Mother used to sing the songs in German and her voice would echo across the valleys
AUNT MORAG => Oh what happened?
FLORA => One day when my mother and father were singing together in the forest, a great storm blew up out of nowhere. But so passionate was their singing that they did not notice, nor did they stop as the rain began to fall and when their voices rose for the final bars of the duet a great bolt of lightening came out of the sky and struck my father so that he lit up like a torch... And at the same moment my father was struck dead my mother was struck dumb! She- never-spoke-another-word.
AUNT MORAG => Ohhh ... dear. Not another word From the shock, yes it would be.
AUNT MORAG => Terrible.  Terrible
STEWART => I shall be gone for some days. There is some Maori land I want and may buy very reasonably. I am hoping you will use the time to settle in, and, in some ways we may start again
STEWART => All right?
BAINES => I'm not able to read.
FLORA => Please take us to the beach where we landed.
BAINES => I'm sorry, I can't do that. (FLORA and ADA stare evenly at him) I don't have the time.  Goodbye
BAINES => I - can't - take - you there. I can't do it.
STEWART => Hello, then.
FLORA => Hello.
AUNT MORAG =>  Well you stopped combing your hair, which is a good thing, it was looking over done. (without pause but referring to the sheet) You see these are the slits that the heads will go through, show him Nessie ... they'll be dead, the Reverend is going to use animal blood, no doubt it will be very dramatic. Tea! 
NESSIE => It will be very dramatic.
STEWART =>  What would you think if someone played a kitchen table like it were a piano?
AUNT MORAG => Like it were a piano?
STEWART => It's strange isn't it? I mean it's not a piano, it doesn't make any sound.
AUNT MORAG => Biscuits.' No, no sound.
STEWART => I knew she was mute, but now I'm thinking it's more than that. I'm wondering if she's not brain affected.
AUNT MORAG => No sound at all?
STEWART => No, it was a table.
AUNT MORAG => Well, she was very violent with the gown. She tore off a chunk of lace. if hadn't been there I'd have sworn she'd used her teeth
NESSIE => and wiped her feet an it.
STEWART => Well it has not yet come to anything. Just a concern.
AUNT MORAG => Oh, yes, yes of course, a concern.
STEWART => There is something to be said for silence
AUNT MORAG => Oh indeed. Cotton'.
STEWART => And with time she will, I'm sure, become affectionate.
AUNT MORAG => Certainly, there is nothing so easy to like as a pet and they are quite silent.
BAINES => Those 80 acres, that cross the stream, what do you think of them?
STEWART => On your property?
BAINES => Yes
STEWART => Good, flatish land with reliable water, why? I don't have money. What are you about?
BAINES => I'd like to make a swap.
STEWART => What for?
BAINES => The piano.
STEWART => The piano on the beach? Ada's piano?
STEWART => It's not marshy is it?
BAINES => No.
STEWART => You'd have to organise it up here.
BAINES => Yes, I thought that.
STEWART => Well Baines the music lover, I never would have known. Hidden talents George.
BAINES => I'll have to get lessons. It wouldn't be much use without them.
STEWART => Yes, I suppose you would.
STEWART => Well Ada can play.
STEWART => I have it in a letter she plays well. She's been playing since she was 5 or6.
STEWART => I have got us some excellent land. Baines has taken some queer idea to have a piano, and you are to give him lessons. Have you taught before?
FLORA => What on?
STEWART => On your piano, that is the swap.
STEWART => What does she say?
FLORA => She says it's her piano, and she won't have him touch it. He's an oaf, he can't read, he's ignorant.
STEWART => He wants to improve himself... and you will be able to play on it ... (ADA is not responding well) Teach him to look after it.
STEWART => You can't go on like this, we are a family now, all of us make sacrifices and so will you. You will teach him. I shall see to that!
STEWART => I'd try children's tunes, nothing more complicated
STEWART => Just be encouraging no one expects him to be good.
STEWART => It looks good, very nice looking thing. Well . I wish you luck. The girls are very excited about the lessons.
STEWART => Flora will explain anything Ada says. They talk through their fingers, you can't believe what they say with just their hands.
FLORA => My mother wants to see your hands. Hold them out.
FLORA => You have to wash them.
BAINES => They are washed.
FLORA => Wash them again.
BAINES => The marks do not come out. They are scars and hardened skin.
FLORA => There's no tune left in the piano so she can't teach you.
BLIND MAN => Ah, a Broadbent. A fine instrument. I've not come across one here, or in the Islands where I have tuned some 200. Yes, they like their pianos there.
BAINES => I can't play.
BLIND MAN => You don't play?
BAINES => No, I can't.
BLIND MAN => Well my dear Miss Broadbent, tuned, but silent.
FLORA => Mother says she can't stand to teach piano with it all out or tune. So I'm to do scales.
FLORA => I hope you've scrubbed your hands.
FLORA => What's out there?
FLORA => You have to watch me where I put my fingers.
FLORA => It's in tune.
FLORA => I was teaching.
FLORA => She wants to see what you can do.
BAINES => I'd rather not play. I want to listen and learn that way.
FLORA => Everyone has to practice.
BAINES => I just want to listen.
FLORA => What do you want to hear?
BAINES => Anything.
FLORA => Tell me about my real father.
ADA => I didn't need to speak, I could lay thoughts out in his mind like they were a sheet
FLORA => What happened? Why didn't you get married?
ADA cont. => After a while he became frightened and he stopped listening.
STEWART => Shall I kiss you goodnight?
BAINES => Do you know how to bargain, nod if you do.
BAINES => You see I'd like us to make a deal. There's things I want to do while you stay. If you let me you can earn it back.
BAINES => Your dress?
BAINES => Play... Keep playing.
HIRA => I got the good wife for you Peini. She pray good. Clean. Read Bible. You sleep her Peini. She chief daughter.

HIRA => You have spare wife here Peini. You get rnana for that. Our chief four wives.
HIRA => Who do that? It not finish, that no good Peini. You finish!
FLORA =>  I want to speak to my mother
AUNT MORAG => Which sign is the word rehearsal?
AUNT MORAG => I can't imagine a fate worse than being dumb. Turn around.
NESSIE => To be deaf?
AUNT MORAG => Oh yes, dear too - TERRIBLE! AWFUL!"'
FLORA => Actually, to tell you the whole truth, Mama says most people speak rubbish and it's not worth the listen.
AUNT MORAG => Well, that is a strong opinion.
FLORA => Yes, it's unholy.
BAINES => Lift your skirt,
BAINES => Higher.
REVEREND => Nessie, your hand out ... out here, please.
NESSIE => Oh, no use Mr Stewart, I can't act.
REVEREND => Nessie, please.
REVEREND => Look you are being attacked!
REVEREND => And with the blood ... it will be a good effect:
BAINES => Undo your dress. This part, I want to see your arms.
BAINES => Play.
AUNT MORAG => I hardly need to give one to you, but there you are anyway.
STEWART => Wait.
STEWART => How are the lessons going? ADA nods enthusiastically. He's getting on all right? ADA nods again Good.
AUNT MORAG => That is good, yes.
AUNT MORAG => Ah well, slowly, slowly

BAINES => I can't read music, I have just begun.
STEWART => Lot of fools. Come on, move up.
REVEREND => And so the young maid came upon each and all of Bluebeard's missing wives, their severed heads still bleeding, their eyes still crying.
REVEREND => But who it this?

STEWART => Ada says you're doing well with the piano?
STEWART => I'll have to come and hear you play. what do you play.
BAINES => Nothing just yet
STEWART => No. Well I suppose it takes time.
STEWART => Baines can't play a damn thing. Is that right he can't play a thing?
STEWART => What's that?
BAINES => Do what you like. Play what you like.
BAINES => I want to lie together without clothes on. How many would that be?
BAINES => Yes, ten keys.
STEWART => Never behave like that, never any where. You are greatly shamed and you have shamed those trunks.
MAORI WOMEN => What o'clock say Mr Stewart? -Ge Tupeka?  -Time for puff puff.
FLORA => I know why Mr. Baines can't play the piano.
STEWART => You've missed this bit.
FLORA => She never gives him a turn.
STEWART => And when is the next lesson?
FLORA => Tomorrow.
BAINES => I am giving the piano back to you. I've had enough.  The arrangement is making you a whore and me wretched. I want you to care for me, but you can't.
HIRA => George, can I use this comb?
BAINES => It's yours, leave, go on go!
STEWART =>  Stop right there'. This isn't yours  what are you doing with the piano?
FLORA => He's given it to us.
STEWART => Hah, you're very cunning Ada, but I've seen through you, I'm not going to lose the land this way. Wait here!
HIRA => George sick, he don't wanna see nobody. You got Tupeka for the Hira?
STEWART => I don't think you should have given up the piano. I will make sure you are properly taught, with music written on to sheets and...
BAINES => I don't want to learn.
STEWART => You don't want to learn.
BAINES => No.
STEWART => And what does this do to our bargain? I cannot afford the piano if you mean me to pay.
BAINES => No, no payment. I have given it back. I don't want it.
STEWART => Well, I doubt I want it very much myself.
BAINES => It was more to your wife that I gave it.
STEWART => Well, thank you, I expect she will appreciate it.
HIRA => You make BIG mistake George. In first place you should swap land for wife. Now look, she gone, you no land, no music box, you got nothing.
bearers. => One squats catching them as they fall. A commotion begins as one of the MAORIS snatches the whole jar and runs off. Two of them give chase while the others insist on tobacco.
STEWART => Is it all right? Aren't you going to play something? ADA pulls up a chair and seats herself at the piano. She rubs her hands and places them lightly on the keys, she turns from habit over her left shoulder where STEWART waits crossed armed. Quickly she removes her hands, stands and gestures FLORA to play. FLORA proudly takes ~p the seat, she pulls her lips in trying to control her happiness to say in front of both her mother and STEWART.
FLORA => What will I play?
STEWART => Play a gig.
FLORA => Do I know any gigs?
STEWART => Play a song then
STEWART => Why won't she play it? We have it back, and she just wanders off!
STEWART => Keep playing!
FLORA => Why? Why can't I?
FLORA => I shan't practise and I DON'T CARE!
STEWART => Where's your mother? Where has she gone?
FLORA => To HELL!
BAINES => So what brings you here? Did you leave something? I have not found anything.
BAINES => Ada, I am unhappy because I want you, because my mind has seized on you and thinks of nothing else. This is how I suffer, I am sick with longing. I don't eat, I don't sleep. If you do not want me, if you have come with no feeling for me, then go!
BAINES => What?  What?  whisper....
BAINES => Now you are going I am miserable, why is that? (He catches her hand and draws her to hint) Ada I need to know, what will you do? Will you come again?
BAINES => Wait! I don't know what you're thinking. Does this mean something to you? Hey? (Stroking a strand of hair behind her ear) I already miss you. Ada, do you love me?
BAINES => Come tomorrow. If you are serious, come tomorrow.

AUNT MORAG => Alisdair, is it because of our play? Have the natives aggressed you?
NESSIE =>  ... you are quite trapped.
AUNT MORAG => We have just come from George Banes' and they have taken him over. It is no wonder he is leaving, he has got in too deep with the natives. They sit on his floor as proud as Kings, but without a shred of manners.
NESSIE => ... without a shred of manners.
AUNT MORAG => He is quite altered, as if they had been trying some native witchcraft on him. Well tomorrow or the day after he will be gone.
STEWART => Baines is packing up?
AUNT MORAG => Well he has NOTHING to pack, but he is leaving. And it is just as well; Nessie has foolishly grown an affection for him ... we have had some tears

STEWART =>  Has Ada ever spoken to you?
BAINES => You mean in signs?
STEWART => No, words. You have never heard words?
BAINES => No, not words.
STEWART => Never thought you heard words?
STEWART =>  She has spoken to me. I heard her voice. There was no sound, but I beard it here (he presses his forehead with a palm of his hand). Her voice was there in my head. I watched her lips, they did not make the words, yet the harder I listened the clearer I heard her, as clear as I hear you, as dear as I hear my own voice.
BAINES =>  Spoken words?
STEWART => No, but her words are in my head. (he looks at BAINES and pauses) I know what you think, that it's a trick, that I'm making it up. No, the words I heard, were her words.
BAINES => What are they?
STEWART => She said, "I have to go, let me go, let Baines take me away, let him try and save me. I am frightened of my will, of what it might do it is so strange and strong".
BAINES => You punished her wrongly, it was me, my fault.
STEWART => Understand me. I am here for her, for her I wonder that I don't wake, that I am not asleep to be here talking with you. I love her. But what is the use? She doesn't care for me. I wish her gone. I wish you gone. I want to wake and find it was a dream, that is what I want. I want to believe I am not this man. I want my self back; the one I know.
